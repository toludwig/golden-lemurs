    "Readme": "Grit\nGrit is no longer maintained. Check out rugged.\nGrit gives you object oriented read/write access to Git repositories via Ruby.\nThe main goals are stability and performance. To this end, some of the\ninteractions with Git repositories are done by shelling out to the system's\ngit command, and other interactions are done with pure Ruby\nreimplementations of core Git functionality. This choice, however, is\ntransparent to end users, and you need not know which method is being used.\nThis software was developed to power GitHub, and should be considered\nproduction ready. An extensive test suite is provided to verify its\ncorrectness.\nGrit is maintained by Tom Preston-Werner, Scott Chacon, Chris Wanstrath, and\nPJ Hyett.\nThis documentation is accurate as of Grit 2.3.\nRequirements\n\ngit (http://git-scm.com) tested with 1.7.2.1\n\nInstall\nEasiest install is via RubyGems:\n$ gem install grit\n\nSource\nGrit's Git repo is available on GitHub, which can be browsed at:\nhttp://github.com/mojombo/grit\n\nand cloned with:\ngit clone git://github.com/mojombo/grit.git\n\nDevelopment\nYou will need these gems to get tests to pass:\n\nmocha\n\nContributing\nIf you'd like to hack on Grit, follow these instructions. To get all of the dependencies, install the gem first.\n\nFork the project to your own account\nClone down your fork\nCreate a thoughtfully named topic branch to contain your change\nHack away\nAdd tests and make sure everything still passes by running rake\nIf you are adding new functionality, document it in README.md\nDo not change the version number, I will do that on my end\nIf necessary, rebase your commits into logical chunks, without errors\nPush the branch up to GitHub\nSend a pull request for your branch\n\nUsage\nGrit gives you object model access to your Git repositories. Once you have\ncreated a Repo object, you can traverse it to find parent commits,\ntrees, blobs, etc.\nInitialize a Repo object\nThe first step is to create a Grit::Repo object to represent your repo. In\nthis documentation I include the Grit module to reduce typing.\nrequire 'grit'\nrepo = Grit::Repo.new(\"/Users/tom/dev/grit\")\n\nIn the above example, the directory /Users/tom/dev/grit is my working\ndirectory and contains the .git directory. You can also initialize Grit with\na bare repo.\nrepo = Repo.new(\"/var/git/grit.git\")\n\nGetting a list of commits\nFrom the Repo object, you can get a list of commits as an array of Commit\nobjects.\nrepo.commits\n# => [#<Grit::Commit \"e80bbd2ce67651aa18e57fb0b43618ad4baf7750\">,\n      #<Grit::Commit \"91169e1f5fa4de2eaea3f176461f5dc784796769\">,\n      #<Grit::Commit \"038af8c329ef7c1bae4568b98bd5c58510465493\">,\n      #<Grit::Commit \"40d3057d09a7a4d61059bca9dca5ae698de58cbe\">,\n      #<Grit::Commit \"4ea50f4754937bf19461af58ce3b3d24c77311d9\">]\n\nCalled without arguments, Repo#commits returns a list of up to ten commits\nreachable by the master branch (starting at the latest commit). You can\nask for commits beginning at a different branch, commit, tag, etc.\nrepo.commits('mybranch')\nrepo.commits('40d3057d09a7a4d61059bca9dca5ae698de58cbe')\nrepo.commits('v0.1')\n\nYou can specify the maximum number of commits to return.\nrepo.commits('master', 100)\n\nIf you need paging, you can specify a number of commits to skip.\nrepo.commits('master', 10, 20)\n\nThe above will return commits 21-30 from the commit list.\nThe Commit object\nCommit objects contain information about that commit.\nhead = repo.commits.first\n\nhead.id\n# => \"e80bbd2ce67651aa18e57fb0b43618ad4baf7750\"\n\nhead.parents\n# => [#<Grit::Commit \"91169e1f5fa4de2eaea3f176461f5dc784796769\">]\n\nhead.tree\n# => #<Grit::Tree \"3536eb9abac69c3e4db583ad38f3d30f8db4771f\">\n\nhead.author\n# => #<Grit::Actor \"Tom Preston-Werner <tom@mojombo.com>\">\n\nhead.authored_date\n# => Wed Oct 24 22:02:31 -0700 2007\n\nhead.committer\n# => #<Grit::Actor \"Tom Preston-Werner <tom@mojombo.com>\">\n\nhead.committed_date\n# => Wed Oct 24 22:02:31 -0700 2007\n\nhead.message\n# => \"add Actor inspect\"\n\nYou can traverse a commit's ancestry by chaining calls to #parents.\nrepo.commits.first.parents[0].parents[0].parents[0]\n\nThe above corresponds to master^^^ or master~3 in Git parlance.\nThe Tree object\nA tree records pointers to the contents of a directory. Let's say you want\nthe root tree of the latest commit on the master branch.\ntree = repo.commits.first.tree\n# => #<Grit::Tree \"3536eb9abac69c3e4db583ad38f3d30f8db4771f\">\n\ntree.id\n# => \"3536eb9abac69c3e4db583ad38f3d30f8db4771f\"\n\nOnce you have a tree, you can get the contents.\ncontents = tree.contents\n# => [#<Grit::Blob \"4ebc8aea50e0a67e000ba29a30809d0a7b9b2666\">,\n      #<Grit::Blob \"81d2c27608b352814cbe979a6acd678d30219678\">,\n      #<Grit::Tree \"c3d07b0083f01a6e1ac969a0f32b8d06f20c62e5\">,\n      #<Grit::Tree \"4d00fe177a8407dbbc64a24dbfc564762c0922d8\">]\n\nThis tree contains two Blob objects and two Tree objects. The trees are\nsubdirectories and the blobs are files. Trees below the root have additional\nattributes.\ncontents.last.name\n# => \"lib\"\n\ncontents.last.mode\n# => \"040000\"\n\nThere is a convenience method that allows you to get a named sub-object\nfrom a tree.\ntree / \"lib\"\n# => #<Grit::Tree \"e74893a3d8a25cbb1367cf241cc741bfd503c4b2\">\n\nYou can also get a tree directly from the repo if you know its name.\nrepo.tree\n# => #<Grit::Tree \"master\">\n\nrepo.tree(\"91169e1f5fa4de2eaea3f176461f5dc784796769\")\n# => #<Grit::Tree \"91169e1f5fa4de2eaea3f176461f5dc784796769\">\n\nThe Blob object\nA blob represents a file.

    "Readme": "ExceptionLogger\n===============\n\nThe Exception Logger (forgive the horrible name) logs your Rails exceptions in the database and provides a funky web interface to manage them.\n\nFirst you need to generate the migration:\n\n  ./script/generate exception_migration\n\nNext, you'll need to include the ExceptionLoggable module into ApplicationController.  Once that's done you might want to modify key methods to customize the logging:\n\n  render_404(exception) - Shows the 404 template.\n\n  render_500(exception) - Shows the 500 template.\n\n  log_exception(exception) - Logs the actual exception in the database.\n\n  rescue_action_in_public(exception) - Does not log these exceptions: ActiveRecord::RecordNotFound, ActionController::UnknownController, ActionController::UnknownAction\n\nNow add a new route to your routes.rb:\n\n  map.connect \"logged_exceptions/:action/:id\", :controller => \"logged_exceptions\"\n\nAfter that, visit /logged_exceptions in your application to manage the exceptions.\n\nOnce you have done that, open up the vendor/plugins/init.rb file and choose your pagination,\nsupported options are will_paginate, paginating_find, and simple mysql based pagination (Uses LIMIT)\nThe current default is none. To use the other options you need to uncomment the $PAGINATION_TYPE line\nand the require for that pagination, you should comment out what you won't use etc...\n\nIt's understandable that you may want to require authentication.  Add this to your config/environments/production.rb:\n\n  # config/environments/production.rb\n  config.after_initialize do\n    require 'application' unless Object.const_defined?(:ApplicationController)\n    LoggedExceptionsController.class_eval do\n      # set the same session key as the app\n      session :session_key => '_beast_session_id'\n\n      # include any custom auth modules you need\n      include AuthenticationSystem\n\n      before_filter :login_required\n\n      # optional, sets the application name for the rss feeds\n      self.application_name = \"Beast\"\n\n      protected\n        # only allow admins\n        # this obviously depends on how your auth system works\n        def authorized?\n          current_user.is_a?(Admin)\n        end\n\n        # assume app's login required doesn't use http basic\n        def login_required_with_basic\n          respond_to do |accepts|\n            # alias_method_chain will alias the app's login_required to login_required_without_basic\n            accepts.html { login_required_without_basic }\n\n            # access_denied_with_basic_auth is defined in LoggedExceptionsController\n            # get_auth_data returns back the user/password pair\n            accepts.rss do\n              access_denied_with_basic_auth unless self.current_user = User.authenticate(*get_auth_data)\n            end\n          end\n        end\n\n        alias_method_chain :login_required, :basic\n    end\n  end\n\nThe exact code of course depends on the specific needs of your application.\n\nCREDITS\n\nJamis Buck  - original exception_notification plugin\nRick Olson  - model/controller code\nJosh Goebel - design\nJason Knight - Pagination support, built on/inspired by Ryanb's willpaginate support.\n\n",

A model with migration is created, as well as a\nbasic controller with the create method. You probably want to say \"User\" here.\nThe second parameter specifies the session controller name.  This is the\ncontroller that handles the actual login/logout function on the site.\n(probably: \"Session\").\n--include-activation: Generates the code for a ActionMailer and its respective\nActivation Code through email.\n--stateful: Builds in support for acts_as_state_machine and generates\nactivation code.  (@--stateful@ implies @--include-activation@). Based on the\nidea at [[http://www.vaporbase.com/postings/stateful_authentication]]. Passing\n@--skip-migration@ will skip the user migration, and @--skip-routes@ will skip\nresource generation -- both useful if you've already run this generator.\n(Needs the \"acts_as_state_machine plugin\":http://elitists.textdriven.com/svn/plugins/acts_as_state_machine/,\nbut new installs should probably run with @--aasm@ instead.)\n--aasm: Works the same as stateful but uses the \"updated aasm gem\":http://github.com/rubyist/aasm/tree/master\n--rspec: Generate RSpec tests and Stories in place of standard rails tests.\nThis requires the\n  \"RSpec and Rspec-on-rails plugins\":http://rspec.info/\n(make sure you \"./script/generate rspec\" after installing RSpec.)  The rspec\nand story suite are much more thorough than the rails tests, and changes are\nunlikely to be backported.\n--old-passwords: Use the older password scheme (see [[#COMPATIBILITY]], above)\n--skip-migration: Don't generate a migration file for this model\n--skip-routes: Don't generate a resource line in @config/routes.rb@\n\n\n \nAfter installing\nThe below assumes a Model named 'User' and a Controller named 'Session'; please\nalter to suit. There are additional security minutae in @notes/README-Tradeoffs@\n-- only the paranoid or the curious need bother, though.\n\nAdd these familiar login URLs to your @config/routes.rb@ if you like:\n\nmap.signup  '/signup', :controller => 'users',   :action => 'new'\nmap.login  '/login',  :controller => 'session', :action => 'new'\nmap.logout '/logout', :controller => 'session', :action => 'destroy'\n\nWith @--include-activation@, also add to your @config/routes.rb@:\n\nmap.activate '/activate/:activation_code', :controller => 'users', :action => 'activate', :activation_code => nil\n\nand add an observer to @config/environment.rb@:\n\n  config.active_record.observers = :user_observer\n  \nPay attention, may be this is not an issue for everybody, but if you should\nhave problems, that the sent activation_code does match with that in the\ndatabase stored, reload your user object before sending its data through email\nsomething like:\n\n  class UserObserver < ActiveRecord::Observer\n    def after_create(user)\n      user.reload\n      UserMailer.deliver_signup_notification(user)\n    end\n    def after_save(user)\n      user.reload\n      UserMailer.deliver_activation(user) if user.recently_activated?\n    end\n  end\n  \nWith @--stateful@, add an observer to config/environment.rb:\n\nconfig.active_record.observers = :user_observer\n\nand modify the users resource line to read\nmap.resources :users, :member => { :suspend   => :put,\n                                     :unsuspend => :put,\n                                     :purge     => :delete }\nIf you use a public repository for your code (such as github, rubyforge,\ngitorious, etc.) make sure to NOT post your site_keys.rb (add a line like\n'/config/initializers/site_keys.rb' to your .gitignore or do the svn ignore\ndance), but make sure you DO keep it backed up somewhere safe.\n\n",

    "Readme": "attachment-fu\n=============\n\nattachment_fu is a plugin by Rick Olson (aka technoweenie <http://techno-weenie.net>) and is the successor to acts_as_attachment.  To get a basic run-through of its capabilities, check out Mike Clark's tutorial <http://clarkware.com/cgi/blosxom/2007/02/24#FileUploadFu>.\n\n\nattachment_fu functionality\n===========================\n\nattachment_fu facilitates file uploads in Ruby on Rails.  There are a few storage options for the actual file data, but the plugin always at a minimum stores metadata for each file in the database.\n\nThere are four storage options for files uploaded through attachment_fu:\n  File system\n  Database file\n  Amazon S3\n  Rackspace (Mosso) Cloud Files\n\nEach method of storage many options associated with it that will be covered in the following section.  Something to note, however, is that the Amazon S3 storage requires you to modify config/amazon_s3.yml, the Rackspace Cloud Files storage requires you to modify config/rackspace_cloudfiles.yml, and the Database file storage requires an extra table.\n\n\nattachment_fu models\n====================\n\nFor all three of these storage options a table of metadata is required.  This table will contain information about the file (hence the 'meta') and its location.  This table has no restrictions on naming, unlike the extra table required for database storage, which must have a table name of db_files (and by convention a model of DbFile).\n\nIn the model there are two methods made available by this plugins: has_attachment and validates_as_attachment.\n\nhas_attachment(options = {})\n  This method accepts the options in a hash:\n    :content_type     # Allowed content types.\n                      # Allows all by default.  Use :image to allow all standard image types.\n    :min_size         # Minimum size allowed.\n                      # 1 byte is the default.\n    :max_size         # Maximum size allowed.\n                      # 1.megabyte is the default.\n    :size             # Range of sizes allowed.\n                      # (1..1.megabyte) is the default.  This overrides the :min_size and :max_size options.\n    :resize_to        # Used by RMagick to resize images.\n                      # Pass either an array of width/height, or a geometry string.\n    :thumbnails       # Specifies a set of thumbnails to generate.\n                      # This accepts a hash of filename suffixes and RMagick resizing options.\n                      # This option need only be included if you want thumbnailing.\n    :thumbnail_class  # Set which model class to use for thumbnails.\n                      # This current attachment class is used by default.\n    :path_prefix      # Path to store the uploaded files in.\n                      # Uses public/#{table_name} by default for the filesystem, and just #{table_name} for the S3 and Cloud Files backend.  \n                      # Setting this sets the :storage to :file_system.\n    :partition        # Whether to partiton files in directories like /0000/0001/image.jpg. Default is true. Only applicable to the :file_system backend.\n    :storage          # Specifies the storage system to use..\n                      # Defaults to :db_file.  Options are :file_system, :db_file, :s3, and :cloud_files.\n    :cloudfront       # If using S3 for storage, this option allows for serving the files via Amazon CloudFront.\n                      # Defaults to false.\n    :processor        # Sets the image processor to use for resizing of the attached image.\n                      # Options include ImageScience, Rmagick, and MiniMagick.  Default is whatever is installed.\n    :uuid_primary_key # If your model's primary key is a 128-bit UUID in hexadecimal format, then set this to true.\n    :association_options  # attachment_fu automatically defines associations with thumbnails with has_many and belongs_to. If there are any additional options that you want to pass to these methods, then specify them here.\n\n\n  Examples:\n    has_attachment :max_size => 1.kilobyte\n    has_attachment :size => 1.megabyte..2.megabytes\n    has_attachment :content_type => 'application/pdf'\n    has_attachment :content_type => ['application/pdf', 'application/msword', 'text/plain']\n    has_attachment :content_type => :image, :resize_to => [50,50]\n    has_attachment :content_type => ['application/pdf', :image], :resize_to => 'x50'\n    has_attachment :thumbnails => { :thumb => [50, 50], :geometry => 'x50' }\n    has_attachment :storage => :file_system, :path_prefix => 'public/files'\n    has_attachment :storage => :file_system, :path_prefix => 'public/files', \n                   :content_type => :image, :resize_to => [50,50], :partition => false\n    has_attachment :storage => :file_system, :path_prefix => 'public/files',\n                   :thumbnails => { :thumb => [50, 50], :geometry => 'x50' }\n    has_attachment :storage => :s3\n    has_attachment :store => :s3, :cloudfront => true\n    has_attachment :storage => :cloud_files\n\nvalidates_as_attachment\n  This method prevents files outside of the valid range (:min_size to :max_size, or the :size range) from being saved.  It does not however, halt the upload of such files.  They will be uploaded into memory regardless of size before validation.\n\n  Example:\n    validates_as_attachment\n\n\nattachment_fu migrations\n========================\n\nFields for attachment_fu metadata tables...\n  in general:\n    size,         :integer  # file size in bytes\n    content_type, :string   # mime type, ex: application/mp3\n    filename,     :string   # sanitized filename\n  that reference images:\n    height,       :integer  # in pixels\n    width,        :integer  # in pixels\n  that reference images that will be thumbnailed:\n    parent_id,    :integer  # id of parent image (on the same table, a self-referencing foreign-key).\n                            # Only populated if the current object is a thumbnail.\n    thumbnail,    :string   # the 'type' of thumbnail this attachment record describes.  \n                            # Only populated if the current object is a thumbnail.\n                            # Usage:\n                            # [ In Model 'Avatar' ]\n                            #   has_attachment :content_type => :image, \n                            #                  :storage => :file_system, \n                            #                  :max_size => 500.kilobytes,\n                            #                  :resize_to => '320x200>',\n                            #                  :thumbnails => { :small => '10x10>',\n                            #                                   :thumb => '100x100>' }\n                            # [ Elsewhere ]\n                            # @user.avatar.thumbnails.first.thumbnail #=> 'small'\n  that reference files stored in the database (:db_file):\n    db_file_id,   :integer  # id of the file in the database (foreign key)\n\nField for attachment_fu db_files table:\n  data, :binary # binary file data, for use in database file storage\n\n\nattachment_fu views\n===================\n\nThere are two main views tasks that will be directly affected by attachment_fu: upload forms and displaying uploaded images.\n\nThere are two parts of the upload form that differ from typical usage.\n  1. Include ':multipart => true' in the html options of the form_for tag.\n    Example:\n      <% form_for(:attachment_metadata, :url => { :action => \"create\" }, :html => { :multipart => true }) do |form| %>\n\n  2. Use the file_field helper with :uploaded_data as the field name.\n    Example:\n      <%= form.file_field :uploaded_data %>\n\nDisplaying uploaded images is made easy by the public_filename method of the ActiveRecord attachment objects using file system, s3, and Cloud Files storage.\n\npublic_filename(thumbnail = nil)\n  Returns the public path to the file.  If a thumbnail prefix is specified it will return the public file path to the corresponding thumbnail.\n  Examples:\n    attachment_obj.public_filename          #=> /attachments/2/file.jpg\n    attachment_obj.public_filename(:thumb)  #=> /attachments/2/file_thumb.jpg\n    attachment_obj.public_filename(:small)  #=> /attachments/2/file_small.jpg\n\nWhen serving files from database storage, doing more than simply downloading the file is beyond the scope of this document.\n\n\nattachment_fu controllers\n=========================\n\nThere are two considerations to take into account when using attachment_fu in controllers.\n\nThe first is when the files have no publicly accessible path and need to be downloaded through an action.\n\nExample:\n  def readme\n    send_file '/path/to/readme.txt', :type => 'plain/text', :disposition => 'inline'\n  end\n\nSee the possible values for send_file for reference.\n\n\nThe second is when saving the file when submitted from a form.\nExample in view:\n <%= form.file_field :attachable, :uploaded_data %>\n\nExample in controller:\n  def create\n    @attachable_file = AttachmentMetadataModel.new(params[:attachable])\n    if @attachable_file.save\n      flash[:notice] = 'Attachment was successfully created.'\n      redirect_to attachable_url(@attachable_file)     \n    else\n      render :action => :new\n    end\n  end\n\nattachement_fu scripting\n====================================\n\nYou may wish to import a large number of images or attachments. \nThe following example shows how to upload a file from a script. \n\n#!/usr/bin/env ./script/runner\n\n# required to use ActionController::TestUploadedFile \nrequire 'action_controller'\nrequire 'action_controller/test_process.rb'\n\npath = \"./public/images/x.jpg\"\n\n# mimetype is a string like \"image/jpeg\". One way to get the mimetype for a given file on a UNIX system\n# mimetype = `file -ib #{path}`.gsub(/\\n/,\"\")\n\nmimetype = \"image/jpeg\"\n\n# This will \"upload\" the file at path and create the new model.\n@attachable = AttachmentMetadataModel.new(:uploaded_data => ActionController::TestUploadedFile.new(path, mimetype))\n@attachable.save\n\n",

    "Name": "bong",
    "Readme": "bong\n    by Geoffrey Grosenbach\n    boss@topfunky.com\n    http://topfunky.com\n\n== DESCRIPTION:\n\nHit your website with bong. Uses httperf to run a suite of benchmarking tests against specified urls on your site. \n\nGraphical output and multi-test comparisons are planned. Apache ab support may be added in the future.\n\n== USAGE\n\nSee all options with:\n\n  % bong --help\n\nGenerate a config file (writes to config/httperf.yml by default):\n\n  % bong --generate \n\nEdit the config file with a list of servers, urls, and your preferred sample size. NOTE: Don't run this against servers you don't own!\n\n  --- \n  uris: \n  - /\n  - /pages/about\n  samples: 2\n  servers: \n  - localhost:3000\n\nRun the benchmarking suite, label it 'baseline', and output the raw data to a file (writes output to log/httperf-report.yml by default):\n\n  % bong baseline\n\nA report will be printed to the screen and the raw data will be saved to log/httperf-report.yml (change with the --out option). It's a good idea to use a label for each test so you can compare them later and find out what the fastest implementation was. Examples: 'baseline', 'memcached-optimization', 'sql-queries', etc.\n\n  baseline\n    localhost\n      /               37-56 req/sec\n      /products.rss   395-403 req/sec\n    example.com\n      /               35-58 req/sec\n      /products.rss   400-407 req/sec\n\nView the saved report again with:\n\n  % bong baseline -r log/httperf-report.yml\n\nLather, rinse, repeat.\n\n== LIMITATIONS\n\n* Can't access pages that require login.\n* HTTP GET only.\n\n== REQUIREMENTS\n\nThe httperf command-line tool must be installed. Get it here: \n\n  http://www.hpl.hp.com/research/linux/httperf/download.php\n\nYou must start a webserver (or just Mongrel). Ideally, this would be on a different machine over a fast network. You can also run bong against the local machine or (less ideally) against a remote machine over a slow network, but these will give different performance numbers and may not be accurate.\n\nInternally, bong will\n\n* Run a short series of 5 hits against a URL.\n* Calculate the number of hits needed to run for 10 seconds, or 2 samples. You can change this in the config file, but 2 is the minimum for getting a meaningful standard deviation out of the report.\n* A test will be run again.\n* A short report will be displayed and the raw data will be saved for later comparison.\n\nSee http://peepcode.com/products/benchmarking-with-httperf for a full tutorial on httperf (produced by Geoffrey Grosenbach, technical editing by Zed Shaw).\n\n== INSTALL:\n\n* sudo gem install bong\n\n== EXPERIMENTAL GRAPHS\n\nAfter running bong a number of times, provide a visual output with time on the x axis and req/second on the y axis. Intended to show the change in performance throughout the development of a project.\n\nAssumptions\n\n* Each run will be named \"benchmark-1216122887\" where the second part can be converted to a Time class using Time.at(..)\n* Runs will be displayed at equal intervals along the x axis regardless of if the time between them is uniform\n* Several URLs may be incldued. rps for each one will be of a similar order of magnitude, so it makes sense to graph them together\n* Not all URLs will have data in all runs. However once a url is added it will be in ALL subsequent runs\n\n== LICENSE:\n\n(The MIT License)\n\nCopyright (c) 2007 Topfunky Corporation\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining\na copy of this software and associated documentation files (the\n'Software'), to deal in the Software without restriction, including\nwithout limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish,\ndistribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to\npermit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to\nthe following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be\nincluded in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED 'AS IS', WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,\nEXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF\nMERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.\nIN NO EVENT SHALL THE AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY\nCLAIM, DAMAGES OR OTHER LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT,\nTORT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM, OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE\nSOFTWARE OR THE USE OR OTHER DEALINGS IN THE SOFTWARE.\n\n",

Just make sure you call\nresource_controller before you use any other r_c functionality in your\ncontroller.\nNobody just uses the default RESTful controller, though. \nresource_controller provides a simple API for customizations.\nAction Lifecycle\nIt's really easy to make changes to the lifecycle of your actions.\nNote: We had to call the new accessor \"new_action\", since new is somewhat reserved in ruby.\nBefore and After\nclass ProjectsController < ResourceController::Base\n\n  new_action.before do\n    3.times { object.tasks.build }\n  end\n\n  create.after do\n    object.creator = current_user\n  end\n\nend\nFlash\nclass ProjectsController < ResourceController::Base\n  create.flash \"Can you believe how easy it is to use resource_controller?  Neither could I!\"\nend\nrespond_to\nYou can add to what's already there\u2026\nclass ProjectsController < ResourceController::Base      \n  create.wants.js { render :template => \"show.rjs\" }\nend\nOr you can create a whole new block.  This syntax destroys everything\nthat's there, and starts again\u2026\nclass ProjectsController < ResourceController::Base      \n  create.response do |wants|\n    wants.html\n    wants.js { render :template => \"show.rjs\" }\n  end\nend\nIf you have a nested resource and want to redirect to the parent after\ncreate/update and destroy you can do this in the object controller\nclass CommentsController < ResourceController::Base\n   belongs_to :post\n\n   create.wants.html { redirect_to smart_url(parent_url_options) } \n   update.wants.html { redirect_to smart_url(parent_url_options) } \n   destroy.wants.html { redirect_to smart_url(parent_url_options) }\n end\nScoping\nBecause sometimes you want to make a bunch of customizations at once, most\nof the helpers accept blocks that make grouping calls really easy.  Is it a\nDSL?  Maybe; maybe not.  But, it's definitely awesome.\nWith actions that can fail, the scoping defaults to success.  That means\nthat create.flash == create.success.flash.\nclass ProjectsController < ResourceController::Base\n\n  create do\n    flash \"Object successfully created!\"\n    wants.js { render :template => \"show.rjs\" }\n\n    failure.wants.js { render :template => \"display_errors.rjs\" }\n  end\n\n  destroy do\n    flash \"You destroyed your project.  Good work.\"\n\n    failure do\n      flash \"You cannot destroy that project.  Stop trying!\"\n      wants.js { render :template => \"display_errors.rjs\" }\n    end\n  end\n\nend\nSingleton Resource\nIf you want to create a singleton RESTful controller inherit from\nResourceController::Singleton.\nclass AccountsController < ResourceController::Singleton\nend\n\u2026or if need to inherit from some other class:\nclass AccountsController < ApplicationController\n  resource_controller :singleton\nend\nNote: This type of controllers handle a single resource only so the\nindex action and all the collection helpers (collection_url,\ncollection_path\u2026) are not available for them.\nLoading objects in singletons is similar to plural controllers with one\nexception. For non-nested singleton controllers you should override the\nobject method as it defaults to nil for them.\nclass AccountsController < ResourceController::Singleton\n  private\n    def object\n      @object ||= Account.find(session[:account_id])\n    end\n end\nIn other cases you can use the default logic and override it only if you\nuse permalinks or anything special.\nSingleton nesting with both :has_many and :has_one associations is\nprovided\u2026\nmap.resource :account, :has_many => :options  # /account/options, account is a singleton parent\nmap.resources :users, :has_one => :image  # /users/1/image, image is a singleton child\nIf you have the :has_many association with a singleton parent remember to\noverride parent_object for your :has_many controller as it returns nil by\ndefault in this case.\nclass OptionsController < ResourceController::Base\n  belongs_to :account\n\n  protected\n  def parent_object\n    Account.find(session[:account_id])\n  end\nend\nHelpers (ResourceController::Helpers)\nLoading objects\nYou want to add something like pagination to your controller\u2026\nclass PostsController < ResourceController::Base\n  private\n    def collection\n      @collection ||= end_of_association_chain.find(:all, :page => {:size => 10, :current => params[:page]})\n    end\nend\nOr maybe you used a permalink\u2026\nclass PostsController < ResourceController::Base\n  private\n    def object\n      @object ||= end_of_association_chain.find_by_permalink(param)\n    end\nend\nBuilding objects\nMaybe you have some alternative way of building objects\u2026\nclass PostsController < ResourceController::Base\n  private\n    def build_object\n      @object ||= end_of_association_chain.build_my_object_some_funky_way object_params\n    end\nend\n\u2026and there are tons more helpers in the ResourceController::Helpers\nNested Resources\nNested controllers can be a pain, especially if routing is such that you\nmay or may not have a parent.  Not so with Resource Controller.\nclass CommentsController < ResourceController::Base\n  belongs_to :post\nend\nAll of the finding, and creation, and everything will be done at the scope\nof the post automatically.\nNamespaced Resources\n\u2026are handled automatically, and any namespaces are always available,\nsymbolized, in array form @ ResourceController::Helpers#namespaces\nPolymorphic Resources\nEverything, including url generation is handled completely automatically. \nTake this example\u2026\n## comment.rb\nclass Comment\n  belongs_to :commentable, :polymorphic => true\nend\n\n## comments_controller.rb\nclass CommentsController < ResourceController::Base\n  belongs_to :post, :product, :user\nend\n*Note:* Your model doesn't have to be polymorphic in the ActiveRecord sense.  It can be associated in whichever way you want.\n\n## routes.rb\nmap.resources :posts, :has_many => :comments\nmap.resources :products, :has_many => :comments\nmap.resources :users, :has_many => :comments\nAll you have to do is that, and r_c will infer whichever relationship is\npresent, and perform all the actions at the scope of the parent object.\nParent Helpers\nYou also get some helpers for reflecting on your parent.\nparent?       # => true/false is there a parent present?\nparent_type   # => :post\nparent_model  # => Post\nparent_object # => @post\nNon-standard resource names\nresource_controller supports overrides for every non-standard configuration\nof resources.\nThe most common example is where the resource has a different name than the\nassociated model.  Simply overriding the model_name helper will get\nresource_controller working with your model.\nmap.resources :tags\n...\nclass PhotoTag < ActiveRecord::Base\n...\nclass TagsController < ResourceController::Base\n  private\n    def model_name\n      'photo_tag'\n    end\nend\nIn the above example, the variable, and params will be set to @tag, @tags,\nand params.  If you'd like to change that,\noverride object_name.\ndef object_name\n  'photo_tag'\nend\nIf you're using a non-standard controller name, but everything else is\nstandard, overriding resource_name will propagate through all of the other\nhelpers.\nmap.resources :tags, :controller => \"somethings\"\n...\nclass Tag < ActiveRecord::Base\n...\nclass SomethingsController < ResourceController::Base\n  private\n    def resource_name\n      'tag'\n    end\nend\nFinally, the route_name helper is used by Urligence to determine which url\nhelper to call, so if you have non-standard route names, override it.\nmap.resources :tags, :controller => \"taggings\"\n...\nclass Taggings < ActiveRecord::Base\n...\nclass TaggingsController < ResourceController::Base\n  private\n    def route_name\n      'tag'\n    end\nend\nUrl Helpers\nThanks to Urligence, you also get some free url helpers.\nNo matter what your controller looks like\u2026\n[edit_|new_]object_url # is the equivalent of saying [edit_|new_]post_url(@post)\n[edit_|new_]object_url(some_other_object) # allows you to specify an object, but still maintain any paths or namespaces that are present\n\ncollection_url # is like saying posts_url\nUrl helpers are especially useful when working with polymorphic\ncontrollers.\n# /posts/1/comments\nobject_url          # => /posts/1/comments/#{@comment.to_param}\nobject_url(comment) # => /posts/1/comments/#{comment.to_param}\nedit_object_url     # => /posts/1/comments/#{@comment.to_param}/edit\ncollection_url      # => /posts/1/comments\n\n# /products/1/comments\nobject_url          # => /products/1/comments/#{@comment.to_param}\nobject_url(comment) # => /products/1/comments/#{comment.to_param}\nedit_object_url     # => /products/1/comments/#{@comment.to_param}/edit\ncollection_url      # => /products/1/comments\n\n# /comments\nobject_url          # => /comments/#{@comment.to_param}\nobject_url(comment) # => /comments/#{comment.to_param}\nedit_object_url     # => /comments/#{@comment.to_param}/edit\ncollection_url      # => /comments\nOr with namespaced, nested controllers\u2026\n# /admin/products/1/options\nobject_url          # => /admin/products/1/options/#{@option.to_param}\nobject_url(option)  # => /admin/products/1/options/#{option.to_param}\nedit_object_url     # => /admin/products/1/options/#{@option.to_param}/edit\ncollection_url      # => /admin/products/1/options\nYou get the idea.

    "Name": "markaby",
    "Readme": "= Markaby (Markup as Ruby)\n\nMarkaby is a very short bit of code for writing HTML pages in pure Ruby.\nIt is an alternative to ERb which weaves the two languages together.\nAlso a replacement for templating languages which use primitive languages\nthat blend with HTML.\n\n== Using Markaby as a Rails plugin\n\nWrite Rails templates in pure Ruby.  Example layout:\n\n  html do\n    head do\n      title 'Products: ' + action_name\n      stylesheet_link_tag 'scaffold'\n    end\n\n    body do\n      p flash[:notice], :style => \"color: green\"\n\n      self << content_for_layout\n    end\n  end\n\n== Using Markaby as a Ruby class\n\nMarkaby is flaming easy to call from your Ruby classes.\n\n  require 'markaby'\n\n  mab = Markaby::Builder.new\n  mab.html do\n    head { title \"Boats.com\" }\n    body do\n      h1 \"Boats.com has great deals\"\n      ul do\n        li \"$49 for a canoe\"\n        li \"$39 for a raft\"\n        li \"$29 for a huge boot that floats and can fit 5 people\"\n      end\n    end\n  end\n  puts mab.to_s\n\nMarkaby::Builder.new does take two arguments for passing in variables and\na helper object.  You can also affix the block right on to the class.\n\nSee Markaby::Builder for all of that.\n\n= A Note About <tt>instance_eval</tt>\n\nThe Markaby::Builder class is different from the normal Builder class,\nsince it uses <tt>instance_eval</tt> when running blocks.  This cleans\nup the appearance of the Markaby code you write.  If <tt>instance_eval</tt>\nwas not used, the code would look like this:\n\n  mab = Markaby::Builder.new\n  mab.html do\n    mab.head { mab.title \"Boats.com\" }\n    mab.body do\n      mab.h1 \"Boats.com has great deals\"\n    end\n  end\n  puts mab.to_s\n\nSo, the advantage is the cleanliness of your code.  The disadvantage is that\nthe block will run inside the Markaby::Builder object's scope.  This means\nthat inside these blocks, <tt>self</tt> will be your Markaby::Builder object.\nWhen you use instance variables in these blocks, they will be instance variables\nof the Markaby::Builder object.\n\nThis doesn't affect Rails users, but when used in regular Ruby code, it can\nbe a bit disorienting.  You are recommended to put your Markaby code in a\nmodule where it won't mix with anything.\n\n= The Six Steps of Markaby\n\nIf you dive right into Markaby, it'll probably make good sense, but you're\nlikely to run into a few kinks.  Why not review these six steps and commit\nthem memory so you can really *know* what you're doing?\n\n== 1. Element Classes\n\nElement classes may be added by hooking methods onto container elements:\n\n  div.entry do\n    h2.entryTitle 'Son of WebPage'\n    div.entrySection %{by Anthony}\n    div.entryContent 'Okay, once again, the idea here is ...'\n  end\n\nWhich results in:\n\n  <div class=\"entry\">\n    <h2 class=\"entryTitle\">Son of WebPage</h2>\n    <div class=\"entrySection\">by Anthony</div>\n    <div class=\"entryContent\">Okay, once again, the idea here is ...</div>\n  </div>\n\n== 2. Element IDs\n\nIDs may be added by the use of bang methods:\n\n  div.page! {\n    div.content! {\n      h1 \"A Short Short Saintly Dog\"\n    }\n  }\n\nWhich results in:\n\n  <div id=\"page\">\n    <div id=\"content\">\n      <h1>A Short Short Saintly Dog</h1>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n\n== 3. Validate Your XHTML 1.0 Output \n\nIf you'd like Markaby to help you assemble valid XHTML documents,\nyou can use the <tt>xhtml_transitional</tt> or <tt>xhtml_strict</tt>\nmethods in place of the normal <tt>html</tt> tag.\n\n  xhtml_strict do\n    head { ... }\n    body { ... }\n  end\n\nThis will add the XML instruction and the doctype tag to your document.\nAlso, a character set meta tag will be placed inside your <tt>head</tt>\ntag.\n\nNow, since Markaby knows which doctype you're using, it checks a big\nlist of valid tags and attributes before printing anything.\n\n  >> div :styl => \"padding: 10px\" do\n  >>   img :src => \"samorost.jpg\"\n  >> end\n  InvalidHtmlError: no such attribute `styl'\n\nMarkaby will also make sure you don't use the same element ID twice!\n\n== 4. Escape or No Escape?\n\nMarkaby uses a simple convention for escaping stuff: if a string\nis an argument, it gets escaped.  If the string is in a block, it\ndoesn't.\n\nThis is handy if you're using something like RedCloth or\nRDoc inside an element.  Pass the string back through the block\nand it'll skip out of escaping.\n\n  div.comment { RedCloth.new(str).to_html }\n\nBut, if we have some raw text that needs escaping, pass it in\nas an argument:\n\n  div.comment raw_str\n\nOne caveat: if you have other tags inside a block, the string\npassed back will be ignored.\n\n  div.comment {\n    div.author \"_why\"\n    div.says \"Torpedoooooes!\"\n    \"<div>Silence.</div>\"\n  }\n\nThe final div above won't appear in the output.  You can't mix\ntag modes like that, friend.\n\n== 5. Auto-stringification\n\nIf you end up using any of your Markaby \"tags\" as a string, the\ntag won't be output.  It'll be up to you to add the new string\nback into the HTML output.\n\nThis means if you call <tt>to_s</tt>, you'll get a string back.\n\n  div.title { \"Rock Bottom\" + span(\" by Robert Wyatt\").to_s }\n\nBut, when you're adding strings in Ruby, <tt>to_s</tt> happens automatically.\n\n  div.title { \"Rock Bottom\" + span(\" by Robert Wyatt\") }\n\nInterpolation works fine.\n\n  div.title { \"Rock Bottom #{span(\" by Robert Wyatt\")}\" }\n\nAnd any other operation you might perform on a string.\n\n  div.menu! \\\n    ['5.gets', 'bits', 'cult', 'inspect', '-h'].map do |category|\n      link_to category\n    end.\n    join( \" | \" )\n\n== 6. The <tt>tag!</tt> Method\n\nIf you need to force a tag at any time, call <tt>tag!</tt> with the\ntag name followed by the possible arguments and block.  The CssProxy\nwon't work with this technique.\n\n  tag! :select, :id => \"country_list\" do\n    countries.each do |country|\n      tag! :option, country\n    end\n  end\n\n= A Note About Rails Helpers\n\nWhen used in Rails templates, the Rails helper object is passed into \nMarkaby::Builder.  When you call helper methods inside Markaby, the output\nfrom those methods will be output to the stream.  This is incredibly\nhandy, since most Rails helpers output HTML tags.\n\n  head do\n    javascript_include_tag 'prototype'\n    autodiscovery_link_tag\n  end\n\nHowever, some methods are designed to give back a String which you can use\nelsewhere.  That's okay!  Every method returns a Fragment object, which can\nbe used as a string.\n\n  p { \"Total is: #{number_to_human_size @file_bytes}\" }\n\nAlso see the Quick Tour above, specifically the stuff about auto-stringification.\n\nIf for any reason you have trouble with fragments, you can just\ncall the <tt>@helpers</tt> object with the method and you'll get\nthe String back and nothing will be output.\n\n  p { \"Total is: #{@helpers.number_to_human_size @file_bytes}\" }\n\nConversely, you may call instance variables from your controller by using\na method and its value will be returned, nothing will be output.\n\n  # Inside imaginary ProductController\n  def list\n    @products = Product.find :all\n  end\n\n  # Inside app/views/product/list.mab\n  products.each do |product|\n    p product.title\n  end\n\n= Credits\n\nMarkaby is a work of immense hope by Tim Fletcher and why the lucky stiff.\nThankyou for giving it a whirl.\n\nMarkaby is inspired by the HTML library within cgi.rb.  Hopefully it will\nturn around and take some cues.\n\n\n",

The first route that\nmatches the request is invoked.\nRoute patterns may include named parameters, accessible via the\nparams hash:\nget '/hello/:name' do\n  # matches \"GET /hello/foo\" and \"GET /hello/bar\"\n  # params[:name] is 'foo' or 'bar'\n  \"Hello #{params[:name]}!\"\nend\nYou can also access named parameters via block parameters:\nget '/hello/:name' do |n|\n  \"Hello #{n}!\"\nend\nRoute patterns may also include splat (or wildcard) parameters, accessible\nvia the params[:splat] array:\nget '/say/*/to/*' do\n  # matches /say/hello/to/world\n  params[:splat] # => [\"hello\", \"world\"]\nend\n\nget '/download/*.*' do\n  # matches /download/path/to/file.xml\n  params[:splat] # => [\"path/to/file\", \"xml\"]\nend\nOr with block parameters:\nget '/download/*.*' do |path, ext|\n  [path, ext] # => [\"path/to/file\", \"xml\"]\nend\nRoute matching with Regular Expressions:\nget %r{/hello/([\\w]+)} do\n  \"Hello, #{params[:captures].first}!\"\nend\nOr with a block parameter:\nget %r{/hello/([\\w]+)} do |c|\n  \"Hello, #{c}!\"\nend\nRoute patterns may have optional parameters:\nget '/posts.?:format?' do\n  # matches \"GET /posts\" and any extension \"GET /posts.json\", \"GET /posts.xml\" etc.\nend\nBy the way, unless you disable the path traversal attack protection (see\nbelow), the request path might be modified before matching against your\nroutes.\nConditions\nRoutes may include a variety of matching conditions, such as the user\nagent:\nget '/foo', :agent => /Songbird (\\d\\.\\d)[\\d\\/]*?/ do\n  \"You're using Songbird version #{params[:agent][0]}\"\nend\n\nget '/foo' do\n  # Matches non-songbird browsers\nend\nOther available conditions are host_name and provides:\nget '/', :host_name => /^admin\\./ do\n  \"Admin Area, Access denied!\"\nend\n\nget '/', :provides => 'html' do\n  haml :index\nend\n\nget '/', :provides => ['rss', 'atom', 'xml'] do\n  builder :feed\nend\nYou can easily define your own conditions:\nset(:probability) { |value| condition { rand <= value } }\n\nget '/win_a_car', :probability => 0.1 do\n  \"You won!\"\nend\n\nget '/win_a_car' do\n  \"Sorry, you lost.\"\nend\nFor a condition that takes multiple values use a splat:\nset(:auth) do |*roles|   # <- notice the splat here\n  condition do\n    unless logged_in? && roles.any? {|role| current_user.in_role? role }\n      redirect \"/login/\", 303\n    end\n  end\nend\n\nget \"/my/account/\", :auth => [:user, :admin] do\n  \"Your Account Details\"\nend\n\nget \"/only/admin/\", :auth => :admin do\n  \"Only admins are allowed here!\"\nend\nReturn Values\nThe return value of a route block determines at least the response body\npassed on to the HTTP client, or at least the next middleware in the Rack\nstack. Most commonly, this is a string, as in the above examples. But other\nvalues are also accepted.\nYou can return any object that would either be a valid Rack response, Rack\nbody object or HTTP status code:\n\nAn Array with three elements: [status (Fixnum), headers (Hash),\nresponse body (responds to #each)]\n\nAn Array with two elements: [status (Fixnum), response body (responds\nto #each)]\n\nAn object that responds to #each and passes nothing but strings to\nthe given block\n\nA Fixnum representing the status code\n\nThat way we can, for instance, easily implement a streaming example:\nclass Stream\n  def each\n    100.times { |i| yield \"#{i}\\n\" }\n  end\nend\n\nget('/') { Stream.new }\nYou can also use the stream helper method (described below) to\nreduce boiler plate and embed the streaming logic in the route.\nCustom Route Matchers\nAs shown above, Sinatra ships with built-in support for using String\npatterns and regular expressions as route matches. However, it does not\nstop there. You can easily define your own matchers:\nclass AllButPattern\n  Match = Struct.new(:captures)\n\n  def initialize(except)\n    @except   = except\n    @captures = Match.new([])\n  end\n\n  def match(str)\n    @captures unless @except === str\n  end\nend\n\ndef all_but(pattern)\n  AllButPattern.new(pattern)\nend\n\nget all_but(\"/index\") do\n  # ...\nend\nNote that the above example might be over-engineered, as it can also be\nexpressed as:\nget // do\n  pass if request.path_info == \"/index\"\n  # ...\nend\nOr, using negative look ahead:\nget %r{^(?!/index$)} do\n  # ...\nend\nStatic Files\nStatic files are served from the ./public directory. You can\nspecify a different location by setting the :public_folder option:\nset :public_folder, File.dirname(__FILE__) + '/static'\nNote that the public directory name is not included in the URL. A file\n./public/css/style.css is made available as\nhttp://example.com/css/style.css.\nUse the :static_cache_control setting (see below) to add\nCache-Control header info.\nViews / Templates\nEach template language is exposed as via its own rendering method. These\nmethods simply return a string:\nget '/' do\n  erb :index\nend\nThis renders views/index.erb.\nInstead of a template name, you can also just pass in the template content\ndirectly:\nget '/' do\n  code = \"<%= Time.now %>\"\n  erb code\nend\nTemplates take a second argument, the options hash:\nget '/' do\n  erb :index, :layout => :post\nend\nThis will render views/index.erb embedded in the\nviews/post.erb (default is views/layout.erb, if it\nexists).\nAny options not understood by Sinatra will be passed on to the template\nengine:\nget '/' do\n  haml :index, :format => :html5\nend\nYou can also set options per template language in general:\nset :haml, :format => :html5\n\nget '/' do\n  haml :index\nend\nOptions passed to the render method override options set via set.\nAvailable Options:\nlocals\n\nList of locals passed to the document. Handy with partials. Example:\nerb \"<%= foo %>\", :locals => {:foo =>\n\"bar\"}\ndefault_encoding\n\nString encoding to use if uncertain. Defaults to\nsettings.default_encoding.\nviews\n\nViews folder to load templates from. Defaults to settings.views.\nlayout\n\nWhether to use a layout (true or false), if it's a\nSymbol, specifies what template to use. Example: erb :index, :layout\n=> !request.xhr?\ncontent_type\n\nContent-Type the template produces, default depends on template language.\nscope\n\nScope to render template under. Defaults to the application instance. If\nyou change this, instance variables and helper methods will not be\navailable.\nlayout_engine\n\nTemplate engine to use for rendering the layout. Useful for languages that\ndo not support layouts otherwise. Defaults to the engine used for the\ntemplate. Example: set :rdoc, :layout_engine => :erb\n\nTemplates are assumed to be located directly under the ./views\ndirectory. To use a different views directory:\nset :views, settings.root + '/templates'\nOne important thing to remember is that you always have to reference\ntemplates with symbols, even if they're in a subdirectory (in this\ncase, use :'subdir/template'). You must use a symbol\nbecause otherwise rendering methods will render any strings passed to them\ndirectly.\nAvailable Template Languages\nSome languages have multiple implementations. To specify what\nimplementation to use (and to be thread-safe), you should simply require it\nfirst:\nrequire 'rdiscount' # or require 'bluecloth'\nget('/') { markdown :index }\nHaml Templates\nDependency\n\nhaml\nFile Extensions\n\n.haml\nExample\n\nhaml :index, :format => :html5\n\nErb Templates\nDependency\n\nerubis or erb (included in\nRuby)\nFile Extensions\n\n.erb, .rhtml or .erubis (Erubis only)\nExample\n\nerb :index\n\nBuilder Templates\nDependency\n\nbuilder\nFile Extensions\n\n.builder\nExample\n\nbuilder { |xml| xml.em \"hi\" }\n\nIt also takes a block for inline templates (see example).\nNokogiri Templates\nDependency\n\nnokogiri\nFile Extensions\n\n.nokogiri\nExample\n\nnokogiri { |xml| xml.em \"hi\" }\n\nIt also takes a block for inline templates (see example).\nSass Templates\nDependency\n\nsass\nFile Extensions\n\n.sass\nExample\n\nsass :stylesheet, :style => :expanded\n\nSCSS Templates\nDependency\n\nsass\nFile Extensions\n\n.scss\nExample\n\nscss :stylesheet, :style => :expanded\n\nLess Templates\nDependency\n\nless\nFile Extensions\n\n.less\nExample\n\nless :stylesheet\n\nLiquid Templates\nDependency\n\nliquid\nFile Extensions\n\n.liquid\nExample\n\nliquid :index, :locals => { :key => 'value' }\n\nSince you cannot call Ruby methods (except for yield) from a\nLiquid template, you almost always want to pass locals to it.\nMarkdown Templates\nDependency\n\nrdiscount, redcarpet, bluecloth, kramdown or maruku\nFile Extensions\n\n.markdown, .mkd and .md\nExample\n\nmarkdown :index, :layout_engine => :erb\n\nIt is not possible to call methods from markdown, nor to pass locals to it.\nYou therefore will usually use it in combination with another rendering\nengine:\nerb :overview, :locals => { :text => markdown(:introduction) }\nNote that you may also call the markdown method from within other\ntemplates:\n%h1 Hello From Haml!\n%p= markdown(:greetings)\nSince you cannot call Ruby from Markdown, you cannot use layouts written in\nMarkdown. However, it is possible to use another rendering engine for the\ntemplate than for the layout by passing the :layout_engine option.\nTextile Templates\nDependency\n\nRedCloth\nFile Extensions\n\n.textile\nExample\n\ntextile :index, :layout_engine => :erb\n\nIt is not possible to call methods from textile, nor to pass locals to it.\nYou therefore will usually use it in combination with another rendering\nengine:\nerb :overview, :locals => { :text => textile(:introduction) }\nNote that you may also call the textile method from within other\ntemplates:\n%h1 Hello From Haml!\n%p= textile(:greetings)\nSince you cannot call Ruby from Textile, you cannot use layouts written in\nTextile. However, it is possible to use another rendering engine for the\ntemplate than for the layout by passing the :layout_engine option.\nRDoc Templates\nDependency\n\nrdoc\nFile Extensions\n\n.rdoc\nExample\n\nrdoc :README, :layout_engine => :erb\n\nIt is not possible to call methods from rdoc, nor to pass locals to it. You\ntherefore will usually use it in combination with another rendering engine:\nerb :overview, :locals => { :text => rdoc(:introduction) }\nNote that you may also call the rdoc method from within other\ntemplates:\n%h1 Hello From Haml!\n%p= rdoc(:greetings)\nSince you cannot call Ruby from RDoc, you cannot use layouts written in\nRDoc. However, it is possible to use another rendering engine for the\ntemplate than for the layout by passing the :layout_engine option.\nRadius Templates\nDependency\n\nradius\nFile Extensions\n\n.radius\nExample\n\nradius :index, :locals => { :key => 'value' }\n\nSince you cannot call Ruby methods directly from a Radius template, you\nalmost always want to pass locals to it.\nMarkaby Templates\nDependency\n\nmarkaby\nFile Extensions\n\n.mab\nExample\n\nmarkaby { h1 \"Welcome!\" }\n\nIt also takes a block for inline templates (see example).\nSlim Templates\nDependency\n\nslim\nFile Extensions\n\n.slim\nExample\n\nslim :index\n\nCreole Templates\nDependency\n\ncreole\nFile Extensions\n\n.creole\nExample\n\ncreole :wiki, :layout_engine => :erb\n\nIt is not possible to call methods from creole, nor to pass locals to it.\nYou therefore will usually use it in combination with another rendering\nengine:\nerb :overview, :locals => { :text => creole(:introduction) }\nNote that you may also call the creole method from within other\ntemplates:\n%h1 Hello From Haml!\n%p= creole(:greetings)\nSince you cannot call Ruby from Creole, you cannot use layouts written in\nCreole. However, it is possible to use another rendering engine for the\ntemplate than for the layout by passing the :layout_engine option.\nCoffeeScript Templates\nDependency\n\ncoffee-script and\na way\nto execute javascript\nFile Extensions\n\n.coffee\nExample\n\ncoffee :index\n\nYajl Templates\nDependency\n\nyajl-ruby\nFile Extensions\n\n.yajl\nExample\n\nyajl :index, :locals => { :key => 'qux' }, :callback\n=> 'present', :variable => 'resource' \n\nThe template source is evaluated as a Ruby string, and the resulting json\nvariable is converted #to_json.\njson = { :foo => 'bar' }\njson[:baz] = key\nThe :callback and :variable options can be used to\ndecorate the rendered object.\nvar resource = {\"foo\":\"bar\",\"baz\":\"qux\"}; present(resource);\nWLang Templates\nDependency\n\nwlang\nFile Extensions\n\n.wlang\nExample\n\nwlang :index, :locals => { :key => 'value' }\n\nSince calling ruby methods is not idiomatic in wlang, you almost always\nwant to pass locals to it. Layouts written in wlang and yield are\nsupported, though.\nEmbedded Templates\nget '/' do\n  haml '%div.title Hello World'\nend\nRenders the embedded template string.\nAccessing Variables in Templates\nTemplates are evaluated within the same context as route handlers. Instance\nvariables set in route handlers are directly accessible by templates:\nget '/:id' do\n  @foo = Foo.find(params[:id])\n  haml '%h1= @foo.name'\nend\nOr, specify an explicit Hash of local variables:\nget '/:id' do\n  foo = Foo.find(params[:id])\n  haml '%h1= bar.name', :locals => { :bar => foo }\nend\nThis is typically used when rendering templates as partials from within\nother templates.\nInline Templates\nTemplates may be defined at the end of the source file:\nrequire 'sinatra'\n\nget '/' do\n  haml :index\nend\n\n__END__\n\n@@ layout\n%html\n  = yield\n\n@@ index\n%div.title Hello world.\nNOTE: Inline templates defined in the source file that requires sinatra are\nautomatically loaded. Call enable :inline_templates explicitly if\nyou have inline templates in other source files.\nNamed Templates\nTemplates may also be defined using the top-level template method:\ntemplate :layout do\n  \"%html\\n  =yield\\n\"\nend\n\ntemplate :index do\n  '%div.title Hello World!'\nend\n\nget '/' do\n  haml :index\nend\nIf a template named \u201clayout\u201d exists, it will be used each time a template\nis rendered. You can individually disable layouts by passing :layout\n=> false or disable them by default via set :haml, :layout\n=> false:\nget '/' do\n  haml :index, :layout => !request.xhr?\nend\nAssociating File Extensions\nTo associate a file extension with a template engine, use\nTilt.register. For instance, if you like to use the file extension\ntt for Textile templates, you can do the following:\nTilt.register :tt, Tilt[:textile]\nAdding Your Own Template Engine\nFirst, register your engine with Tilt, then create a rendering method:\nTilt.register :myat, MyAwesomeTemplateEngine\n\nhelpers do\n  def myat(*args) render(:myat, *args) end\nend\n\nget '/' do\n  myat :index\nend\nRenders ./views/index.myat. See github.com/rtomayko/tilt to\nlearn more about Tilt.\nFilters\nBefore filters are evaluated before each request within the same context as\nthe routes will be and can modify the request and response. Instance\nvariables set in filters are accessible by routes and templates:\nbefore do\n  @note = 'Hi!'\n  request.path_info = '/foo/bar/baz'\nend\n\nget '/foo/*' do\n  @note #=> 'Hi!'\n  params[:splat] #=> 'bar/baz'\nend\nAfter filters are evaluated after each request within the same context and\ncan also modify the request and response. Instance variables set in before\nfilters and routes are accessible by after filters:\nafter do\n  puts response.status\nend\nNote: Unless you use the body method rather than just returning a\nString from the routes, the body will not yet be available in the after\nfilter, since it is generated later on.\nFilters optionally take a pattern, causing them to be evaluated only if the\nrequest path matches that pattern:\nbefore '/protected/*' do\n  authenticate!\nend\n\nafter '/create/:slug' do |slug|\n  session[:last_slug] = slug\nend\nLike routes, filters also take conditions:\nbefore :agent => /Songbird/ do\n  # ...\nend\n\nafter '/blog/*', :host_name => 'example.com' do\n  # ...\nend\nHelpers\nUse the top-level helpers method to define helper methods for use\nin route handlers and templates:\nhelpers do\n  def bar(name)\n    \"#{name}bar\"\n  end\nend\n\nget '/:name' do\n  bar(params[:name])\nend\nAlternatively, helper methods can be separately defined in a module:\nmodule FooUtils\n  def foo(name) \"#{name}foo\" end\nend\n\nmodule BarUtils\n  def bar(name) \"#{name}bar\" end\nend\n\nhelpers FooUtils, BarUtils\nThe effect is the same as including the modules in the application class.\nUsing Sessions\nA session is used to keep state during requests. If activated, you have one\nsession hash per user session:\nenable :sessions\n\nget '/' do\n  \"value = \" << session[:value].inspect\nend\n\nget '/:value' do\n  session[:value] = params[:value]\nend\nNote that enable :sessions actually stores all data in a cookie.\nThis might not always be what you want (storing lots of data will increase\nyour traffic, for instance). You can use any Rack session middleware: in\norder to do so, do not call enable :sessions, but instead\npull in your middleware of choice as you would any other middleware:\nuse Rack::Session::Pool, :expire_after => 2592000\n\nget '/' do\n  \"value = \" << session[:value].inspect\nend\n\nget '/:value' do\n  session[:value] = params[:value]\nend\nTo improve security, the session data in the cookie is signed with a\nsession secret. A random secret is generate for you by Sinatra. However,\nsince this secret will change with every start of your application, you\nmight want to set the secret yourself, so all your application instances\nshare it:\nset :session_secret, 'super secret'\nIf you want to configure it further, you may also store a hash with options\nin the sessions setting:\nset :sessions, :domain => 'foo.com'\nHalting\nTo immediately stop a request within a filter or route use:\nhalt\nYou can also specify the status when halting:\nhalt 410\nOr the body:\nhalt 'this will be the body'\nOr both:\nhalt 401, 'go away!'\nWith headers:\nhalt 402, {'Content-Type' => 'text/plain'}, 'revenge'\nIt is of course possible to combine a template with halt:\nhalt erb(:error)\nPassing\nA route can punt processing to the next matching route using pass:\nget '/guess/:who' do\n  pass unless params[:who] == 'Frank'\n  'You got me!'\nend\n\nget '/guess/*' do\n  'You missed!'\nend\nThe route block is immediately exited and control continues with the next\nmatching route. If no matching route is found, a 404 is returned.\nTriggering Another Route\nSometimes pass is not what you want, instead you would like to get\nthe result of calling another route. Simply use call to achieve\nthis:\nget '/foo' do\n  status, headers, body = call env.merge(\"PATH_INFO\" => '/bar')\n  [status, headers, body.map(&:upcase)]\nend\n\nget '/bar' do\n  \"bar\"\nend\nNote that in the example above, you would ease testing and increase\nperformance by simply moving \"bar\" into a helper used by\nboth /foo and /bar.\nIf you want the request to be sent to the same application instance rather\nthan a duplicate, use call! instead of call.\nCheck out the Rack specification if you want to learn more about\ncall.\nSetting Body, Status Code and Headers\nIt is possible and recommended to set the status code and response body\nwith the return value of the route block. However, in some scenarios you\nmight want to set the body at an arbitrary point in the execution flow. You\ncan do so with the body helper method. If you do so, you can use\nthat method from there on to access the body:\nget '/foo' do\n  body \"bar\"\nend\n\nafter do\n  puts body\nend\nIt is also possible to pass a block to body, which will be\nexecuted by the Rack handler (this can be used to implement streaming, see\n\u201cReturn Values\u201d).\nSimilar to the body, you can also set the status code and headers:\nget '/foo' do\n  status 418\n  headers \\\n    \"Allow\"   => \"BREW, POST, GET, PROPFIND, WHEN\",\n    \"Refresh\" => \"Refresh: 20; http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2324.txt\"\n  body \"I'm a tea pot!\"\nend\nLike body, headers and status with no arguments\ncan be used to access their current values.\nStreaming Responses\nSometimes you want to start sending out data while still generating parts\nof the response body. In extreme examples, you want to keep sending data\nuntil the client closes the connection. You can use the stream\nhelper to avoid creating your own wrapper:\nget '/' do\n  stream do |out|\n    out << \"It's gonna be legen -\\n\"\n    sleep 0.5\n    out << \" (wait for it) \\n\"\n    sleep 1\n    out << \"- dary!\\n\"\n  end\nend\nThis allows you to implement streaming APIs, Server Sent Events and can\nbe used as basis for WebSockets. It can also\nbe used to increase throughput if some but not all content depends on a\nslow resource.\nNote that the streaming behavior, especially the number of concurrent\nrequest, highly depends on the web server used to serve the application.\nSome servers, like WEBRick, might not even support streaming at all. If the\nserver does not support streaming, the body will be sent all at once after\nthe block passed to stream finished executing. Streaming does not\nwork at all with Shotgun.\nIf the optional parameter is set to keep_open, it will not call\nclose on the stream object, allowing you to close it at any later\npoint in the execution flow. This only works on evented servers, like Thin\nand Rainbows. Other servers will still close the stream:\nset :server, :thin\nconnections = []\n\nget '/' do\n  # keep stream open\n  stream(:keep_open) { |out| connections << out }\nend\n\npost '/' do\n  # write to all open streams\n  connections.each { |out| out << params[:message] << \"\\n\" }\n  \"message sent\"\nend\nLogging\nIn the request scope, the logger helper exposes a Logger\ninstance:\nget '/' do\n  logger.info \"loading data\"\n  # ...\nend\nThis logger will automatically take your Rack handler's logging\nsettings into account. If logging is disabled, this method will return a\ndummy object, so you do not have to worry in your routes and filters about\nit.\nNote that logging is only enabled for Sinatra::Application by\ndefault, so if you inherit from Sinatra::Base, you probably want\nto enable it yourself:\nclass MyApp < Sinatra::Base\n  configure :production, :development do\n    enable :logging\n  end\nend\nTo avoid any logging middleware to be set up, set the logging\nsetting to nil. However, keep in mind that logger will in\nthat case return nil. A common use case is when you want to set\nyour own logger. Sinatra will use whatever it will find in\nenv['rack.logger'].\nMime Types\nWhen using send_file or static files you may have mime types\nSinatra doesn't understand. Use mime_type to register them by\nfile extension:\nconfigure do\n  mime_type :foo, 'text/foo'\nend\nYou can also use it with the content_type helper:\nget '/' do\n  content_type :foo\n  \"foo foo foo\"\nend\nGenerating URLs\nFor generating URLs you should use the url helper method, for\ninstance, in Haml:\n%a{:href => url('/foo')} foo\nIt takes reverse proxies and Rack routers into account, if present.\nThis method is also aliased to to (see below for an example).\nBrowser Redirect\nYou can trigger a browser redirect with the redirect helper\nmethod:\nget '/foo' do\n  redirect to('/bar')\nend\nAny additional parameters are handled like arguments passed to\nhalt:\nredirect to('/bar'), 303\nredirect 'http://google.com', 'wrong place, buddy'\nYou can also easily redirect back to the page the user came from with\nredirect back:\nget '/foo' do\n  \"<a href='/bar'>do something</a>\"\nend\n\nget '/bar' do\n  do_something\n  redirect back\nend\nTo pass arguments with a redirect, either add them to the query:\nredirect to('/bar?sum=42')\nOr use a session:\nenable :sessions\n\nget '/foo' do\n  session[:secret] = 'foo'\n  redirect to('/bar')\nend\n\nget '/bar' do\n  session[:secret]\nend\nCache Control\nSetting your headers correctly is the foundation for proper HTTP caching.\nYou can easily set the Cache-Control header with like this:\nget '/' do\n  cache_control :public\n  \"cache it!\"\nend\nPro tip: Set up caching in a before filter:\nbefore do\n  cache_control :public, :must_revalidate, :max_age => 60\nend\nIf you are using the expires helper to set the corresponding\nheader, Cache-Control will be set automatically for you:\nbefore do\n  expires 500, :public, :must_revalidate\nend\nTo properly use caches, you should consider using etag or\nlast_modified. It is recommended to call those helpers\nbefore doing heavy lifting, as they will immediately flush a\nresponse if the client already has the current version in its cache:\nget '/article/:id' do\n  @article = Article.find params[:id]\n  last_modified @article.updated_at\n  etag @article.sha1\n  erb :article\nend\nIt is also possible to use a weak\nETag:\netag @article.sha1, :weak\nThese helpers will not do any caching for you, but rather feed the\nnecessary information to your cache. If you are looking for a quick\nreverse-proxy caching solution, try rack-cache:\nrequire \"rack/cache\"\nrequire \"sinatra\"\n\nuse Rack::Cache\n\nget '/' do\n  cache_control :public, :max_age => 36000\n  sleep 5\n  \"hello\"\nend\nUse the :static_cache_control setting (see below) to add\nCache-Control header info to static files.\nAccording to RFC 2616 your application should behave differently if the\nIf-Match or If-None-Match header is set to * depending on whether\nthe resource requested is already in existence. Sinatra assumes resources\nfor safe (like get) and idempotent (like put) requests are already in\nexistence, whereas other resources (for instance for post requests), are\ntreated as new resources. You can change this behavior by passing in a\n:new_resource option:\nget '/create' do\n  etag '', :new_resource => true\n  Article.create\n  erb :new_article\nend\nIf you still want to use a weak ETag, pass in a :kind option:\netag '', :new_resource => true, :kind => :weak\nSending Files\nFor sending files, you can use the send_file helper method:\nget '/' do\n  send_file 'foo.png'\nend\nIt also takes a couple of options:\nsend_file 'foo.png', :type => :jpg\nThe options are:\nfilename\n\nfile name, in response, defaults to the real file name.\nlast_modified\n\nvalue for Last-Modified header, defaults to the file's mtime.\ntype\n\ncontent type to use, guessed from the file extension if missing.\ndisposition\n\nused for Content-Disposition, possible values: nil (default),\n:attachment and :inline\nlength\n\nContent-Length header, defaults to file size.\nstatus\n\nStatus code to be send. Useful when sending a static file as an error page.\n\nIf supported by the Rack handler, other means than streaming from the Ruby\nprocess will be used. If you use this helper method, Sinatra will\nautomatically handle range requests.\nAccessing the Request Object\nThe incoming request object can be accessed from request level (filter,\nroutes, error handlers) through the request method:\n# app running on http://example.com/example\nget '/foo' do\n  t = %w[text/css text/html application/javascript]\n  request.accept              # ['text/html', '*/*']\n  request.accept? 'text/xml'  # true\n  request.preferred_type(t)   # 'text/html'\n  request.body                # request body sent by the client (see below)\n  request.scheme              # \"http\"\n  request.script_name         # \"/example\"\n  request.path_info           # \"/foo\"\n  request.port                # 80\n  request.request_method      # \"GET\"\n  request.query_string        # \"\"\n  request.content_length      # length of request.body\n  request.media_type          # media type of request.body\n  request.host                # \"example.com\"\n  request.get?                # true (similar methods for other verbs)\n  request.form_data?          # false\n  request[\"SOME_HEADER\"]      # value of SOME_HEADER header\n  request.referrer            # the referrer of the client or '/'\n  request.user_agent          # user agent (used by :agent condition)\n  request.cookies             # hash of browser cookies\n  request.xhr?                # is this an ajax request?\n  request.url                 # \"http://example.com/example/foo\"\n  request.path                # \"/example/foo\"\n  request.ip                  # client IP address\n  request.secure?             # false (would be true over ssl)\n  request.forwarded?          # true (if running behind a reverse proxy)\n  request.env                 # raw env hash handed in by Rack\nend\nSome options, like script_name or path_info, can also be\nwritten:\nbefore { request.path_info = \"/\" }\n\nget \"/\" do\n  \"all requests end up here\"\nend\nThe request.body is an IO or StringIO object:\npost \"/api\" do\n  request.body.rewind  # in case someone already read it\n  data = JSON.parse request.body.read\n  \"Hello #{data['name']}!\"\nend\nAttachments\nYou can use the attachment helper to tell the browser the response\nshould be stored on disk rather than displayed in the browser:\nget '/' do\n  attachment\n  \"store it!\"\nend\nYou can also pass it a file name:\nget '/' do\n  attachment \"info.txt\"\n  \"store it!\"\nend\nDealing with Date and Time\nSinatra offers a time_for helper method, which, from the given\nvalue generates a Time object. It is also able to convert\nDateTime, Date and similar classes:\nget '/' do\n  pass if Time.now > time_for('Dec 23, 2012')\n  \"still time\"\nend\nThis method is used internally by expires, last_modified\nand akin. You can therefore easily extend the behavior of those methods by\noverriding time_for in your application:\nhelpers do\n  def time_for(value)\n    case value\n    when :yesterday then Time.now - 24*60*60\n    when :tomorrow  then Time.now + 24*60*60\n    else super\n    end\n  end\nend\n\nget '/' do\n  last_modified :yesterday\n  expires :tomorrow\n  \"hello\"\nend\nLooking Up Template Files\nThe find_template helper is used to find template files for\nrendering:\nfind_template settings.views, 'foo', Tilt[:haml] do |file|\n  puts \"could be #{file}\"\nend\nThis is not really useful. But it is useful that you can actually override\nthis method to hook in your own lookup mechanism. For instance, if you want\nto be able to use more than one view directory:\nset :views, ['views', 'templates']\n\nhelpers do\n  def find_template(views, name, engine, &block)\n    Array(views).each { |v| super(v, name, engine, &block) }\n  end\nend\nAnother example would be using different directories for different engines:\nset :views, :sass => 'views/sass', :haml => 'templates', :default => 'views'\n\nhelpers do\n  def find_template(views, name, engine, &block)\n    _, folder = views.detect { |k,v| engine == Tilt[k] }\n    folder ||= views[:default]\n    super(folder, name, engine, &block)\n  end\nend\nYou can also easily wrap this up in an extension and share with others!\nNote that find_template does not check if the file really exists\nbut rather calls the given block for all possible paths. This is not a\nperformance issue, since render will use break as soon as\na file is found. Also, template locations (and content) will be cached if\nyou are not running in development mode. You should keep that in mind if\nyou write a really crazy method.\nConfiguration\nRun once, at startup, in any environment:\nconfigure do\n  # setting one option\n  set :option, 'value'\n\n  # setting multiple options\n  set :a => 1, :b => 2\n\n  # same as `set :option, true`\n  enable :option\n\n  # same as `set :option, false`\n  disable :option\n\n  # you can also have dynamic settings with blocks\n  set(:css_dir) { File.join(views, 'css') }\nend\nRun only when the environment (RACK_ENV environment variable) is set to\n:production:\nconfigure :production do\n  ...\nend\nRun when the environment is set to either :production or\n:test:\nconfigure :production, :test do\n  ...\nend\nYou can access those options via settings:\nconfigure do\n  set :foo, 'bar'\nend\n\nget '/' do\n  settings.foo? # => true\n  settings.foo  # => 'bar'\n  ...\nend\nConfiguring attack protection\nSinatra is using Rack::Protection\nto defend you application against common, opportunistic attacks. You can\neasily disable this behavior (which will open your application to tons of\ncommon vulnerabilities):\ndisable :protection\nTo skip a single defense layer, set protection to an options hash:\nset :protection, :except => :path_traversal\nYou can also hand in an array in order to disable a list of protections:\nset :protection, :except => [:path_traversal, :session_hijacking]\nAvailable Settings\nabsolute_redirects\n\nIf disabled, Sinatra will allow relative redirects, however, Sinatra will\nno longer conform with RFC 2616 (HTTP 1.1), which only allows absolute\nredirects.\nEnable if your app is running behind a reverse proxy that has not been set\nup properly. Note that the url helper will still produce absolute\nURLs, unless you pass in false as second parameter.\nDisabled per default.\nadd_charsets\n\nmime types the content_type helper will automatically add the\ncharset info to.\nYou should add to it rather than overriding this option:\nsettings.add_charsets << \"application/foobar\"\napp_file\n\nPath to the main application file, used to detect project root, views and\npublic folder and inline templates.\nbind\n\nIP address to bind to (default: 0.0.0.0). Only used for built-in server.\ndefault_encoding\n\nencoding to assume if unknown (defaults to \"utf-8\").\ndump_errors\n\ndisplay errors in the log.\nenvironment\n\ncurrent environment, defaults to ENV['RACK_ENV'], or\n\"development\" if not available.\nlogging\n\nuse the logger.\nlock\n\nPlaces a lock around every request, only running processing on request per\nRuby process concurrently.\nEnabled if your app is not thread-safe. Disabled per default.\nmethod_override\n\nuse _method magic to allow put/delete forms in browsers that\ndon't support it.\nport\n\nPort to listen on. Only used for built-in server.\nprefixed_redirects\n\nWhether or not to insert request.script_name into redirects if no\nabsolute path is given. That way redirect '/foo' would\nbehave like redirect to('/foo'). Disabled per default.\nprotection\n\nWhether or not to enable web attack protections. See protection section\nabove.\npublic_dir\n\nAlias for public_folder. See below.\npublic_folder\n\nPath to the folder public files are served from. Only used if static file\nserving is enabled (see static setting below). Inferred from\napp_file setting if not set.\nreload_templates\n\nwhether or not to reload templates between requests. Enabled in development\nmode.\nroot\n\nPath to project root folder. Inferred from app_file setting if not\nset.\nraise_errors\n\nraise exceptions (will stop application). Enabled by default when\nenvironment is set to \"test\", disabled\notherwise.\nrun\n\nif enabled, Sinatra will handle starting the web server, do not enable if\nusing rackup or other means.\nrunning\n\nis the built-in server running now? do not change this setting!\nserver\n\nserver or list of servers to use for built-in server. defaults to\n['thin', 'mongrel', 'webrick'], order indicates\npriority.\nsessions\n\nenable cookie based sessions support using Rack::Session::Cookie.\nSee 'Using Sessions' section for more information.\nshow_exceptions\n\nshow a stack trace in the browser when an exception happens. Enabled by\ndefault when environment is set to\n\"development\", disabled otherwise.\nstatic\n\nWhether Sinatra should handle serving static files. Disable when using a\nServer able to do this on its own. Disabling will boost performance.\nEnabled per default in classic style, disabled for modular apps.\nstatic_cache_control\n\nWhen Sinatra is serving static files, set this to add\nCache-Control headers to the responses. Uses the\ncache_control helper. Disabled by default. Use an explicit array\nwhen setting multiple values: set :static_cache_control, [:public,\n:max_age => 300]\nthreaded\n\nIf set to true, will tell Thin to use EventMachine.defer\nfor processing the request.\nviews\n\nPath to the views folder. Inferred from app_file setting if not\nset.\n\nEnvironments\nThere are three predefined environments:\n\"development\", \"production\" and\n\"test\". Environments can be set through the\nRACK_ENV environment variable. The default value is\n\"development\". In this mode, all templates are reloaded\nbetween requests. Special not_found and error handlers\nare installed for this environment so you will see a stack trace in your\nbrowser. In \"production\" and \"test\"\ntemplates are cached by default.\nTo run different environments use the -e option:\nruby my_app.rb -e [ENVIRONMENT]\nYou can use predefined methods: development?, test? and\nproduction? to check which enviroment is currently set.\nError Handling\nError handlers run within the same context as routes and before filters,\nwhich means you get all the goodies it has to offer, like haml,\nerb, halt, etc.\nNot Found\nWhen a Sinatra::NotFound exception is raised, or the\nresponse's status code is 404, the not_found handler is\ninvoked:\nnot_found do\n  'This is nowhere to be found.'\nend\nError\nThe error handler is invoked any time an exception is raised from\na route block or a filter. The exception object can be obtained from the\nsinatra.error Rack variable:\nerror do\n  'Sorry there was a nasty error - ' + env['sinatra.error'].name\nend\nCustom errors:\nerror MyCustomError do\n  'So what happened was...' + env['sinatra.error'].message\nend\nThen, if this happens:\nget '/' do\n  raise MyCustomError, 'something bad'\nend\nYou get this:\nSo what happened was... something bad\nAlternatively, you can install an error handler for a status code:\nerror 403 do\n  'Access forbidden'\nend\n\nget '/secret' do\n  403\nend\nOr a range:\nerror 400..510 do\n  'Boom'\nend\nSinatra installs special not_found and error handlers\nwhen running under the development environment.\nRack Middleware\nSinatra rides on Rack, a minimal\nstandard interface for Ruby web frameworks. One of Rack's most\ninteresting capabilities for application developers is support for\n\u201cmiddleware\u201d \u2013 components that sit between the server and your application\nmonitoring and/or manipulating the HTTP request/response to provide various\ntypes of common functionality.\nSinatra makes building Rack middleware pipelines a cinch via a top-level\nuse method:\nrequire 'sinatra'\nrequire 'my_custom_middleware'\n\nuse Rack::Lint\nuse MyCustomMiddleware\n\nget '/hello' do\n  'Hello World'\nend\nThe semantics of use are identical to those defined for the Rack::Builder\nDSL (most frequently used from rackup files). For example, the use\nmethod accepts multiple/variable args as well as blocks:\nuse Rack::Auth::Basic do |username, password|\n  username == 'admin' && password == 'secret'\nend\nRack is distributed with a variety of standard middleware for logging,\ndebugging, URL routing, authentication, and session handling. Sinatra uses\nmany of these components automatically based on configuration so you\ntypically don't have to use them explicitly.\nYou can find useful middleware in rack, rack-contrib, with\nCodeRack or in the Rack wiki.\nTesting\nSinatra tests can be written using any Rack-based testing library or\nframework. Rack::Test\nis recommended:\nrequire 'my_sinatra_app'\nrequire 'test/unit'\nrequire 'rack/test'\n\nclass MyAppTest < Test::Unit::TestCase\n  include Rack::Test::Methods\n\n  def app\n    Sinatra::Application\n  end\n\n  def test_my_default\n    get '/'\n    assert_equal 'Hello World!', last_response.body\n  end\n\n  def test_with_params\n    get '/meet', :name => 'Frank'\n    assert_equal 'Hello Frank!', last_response.body\n  end\n\n  def test_with_rack_env\n    get '/', {}, 'HTTP_USER_AGENT' => 'Songbird'\n    assert_equal \"You're using Songbird!\", last_response.body\n  end\nend\nSinatra::Base - Middleware, Libraries, and Modular Apps\nDefining your app at the top-level works well for micro-apps but has\nconsiderable drawbacks when building reusable components such as Rack\nmiddleware, Rails metal, simple libraries with a server component, or even\nSinatra extensions. The top-level assumes a micro-app style configuration\n(e.g., a single application file, ./public and ./views\ndirectories, logging, exception detail page, etc.). That's where\nSinatra::Base comes into play:\nrequire 'sinatra/base'\n\nclass MyApp < Sinatra::Base\n  set :sessions, true\n  set :foo, 'bar'\n\n  get '/' do\n    'Hello world!'\n  end\nend\nThe methods available to Sinatra::Base subclasses are exactly as\nthose available via the top-level DSL. Most top-level apps can be converted\nto Sinatra::Base components with two modifications:\n\nYour file should require sinatra/base instead of sinatra;\notherwise, all of Sinatra's DSL methods are imported into the main\nnamespace.\n\nPut your app's routes, error handlers, filters, and options in a\nsubclass of Sinatra::Base.\n\nSinatra::Base is a blank slate. Most options are disabled by\ndefault, including the built-in server. See Options and\nConfiguration for details on available options and their behavior.\nModular vs. Classic Style\nContrary to common belief, there is nothing wrong with classic style. If it\nsuits your application, you do not have to switch to a modular application.\nThe main downsides of using classic style rather than modular style is that\nyou may only have one Sinatra application per Ruby process. If you plan to\nuse more than one, switch to modular style. There is no reason you cannot\nmix modular and classic style.\nIf switching from one style to the other, you should be aware of slightly\ndifferent default settings:\nSetting             Classic                 Modular\n\napp_file            file loading sinatra    file subclassing Sinatra::Base\nrun                 $0 == app_file          false\nlogging             true                    false\nmethod_override     true                    false\ninline_templates    true                    false\nstatic              true                    false\nServing a Modular Application\nThere are two common options for starting a modular app, actively starting\nwith run!:\n# my_app.rb\nrequire 'sinatra/base'\n\nclass MyApp < Sinatra::Base\n  # ... app code here ...\n\n  # start the server if ruby file executed directly\n  run! if app_file == $0\nend\nStart with:\nruby my_app.rb\nOr with a config.ru, which allows using any Rack handler:\n# config.ru\nrequire './my_app'\nrun MyApp\nRun:\nrackup -p 4567\nUsing a Classic Style Application with a config.ru\nWrite your app file:\n# app.rb\nrequire 'sinatra'\n\nget '/' do\n  'Hello world!'\nend\nAnd a corresponding config.ru:\nrequire './app'\nrun Sinatra::Application\nWhen to use a config.ru?\nGood signs you probably want to use a config.ru:\n\nYou want to deploy with a different Rack handler (Passenger, Unicorn,\nHeroku, \u2026).\n\nYou want to use more than one subclass of Sinatra::Base.\n\nYou want to use Sinatra only for middleware, but not as endpoint.\n\nThere is no need to switch to a config.ru only because you\nswitched to modular style, and you don't have to use modular style for\nrunning with a config.ru.\nUsing Sinatra as Middleware\nNot only is Sinatra able to use other Rack middleware, any Sinatra\napplication can in turn be added in front of any Rack endpoint as\nmiddleware itself. This endpoint could be another Sinatra application, or\nany other Rack-based application (Rails/Ramaze/Camping/\u2026):\nrequire 'sinatra/base'\n\nclass LoginScreen < Sinatra::Base\n  enable :sessions\n\n  get('/login') { haml :login }\n\n  post('/login') do\n    if params[:name] == 'admin' && params[:password] == 'admin'\n      session['user_name'] = params[:name]\n    else\n      redirect '/login'\n    end\n  end\nend\n\nclass MyApp < Sinatra::Base\n  # middleware will run before filters\n  use LoginScreen\n\n  before do\n    unless session['user_name']\n      halt \"Access denied, please <a href='/login'>login</a>.\"\n    end\n  end\n\n  get('/') { \"Hello #{session['user_name']}.\" }\nend\nDynamic Application Creation\nSometimes you want to create new applications at runtime without having to\nassign them to a constant, you can do this with Sinatra.new:\nrequire 'sinatra/base'\nmy_app = Sinatra.new { get('/') { \"hi\" } }\nmy_app.run!\nIt takes the application to inherit from as optional argument:\n# config.ru\nrequire 'sinatra/base'\n\ncontroller = Sinatra.new do\n  enable :logging\n  helpers MyHelpers\nend\n\nmap('/a') do\n  run Sinatra.new(controller) { get('/') { 'a' } }\nend\n\nmap('/b') do\n  run Sinatra.new(controller) { get('/') { 'b' } }\nend\nThis is especially useful for testing Sinatra extensions or using Sinatra\nin your own library.\nThis also makes using Sinatra as middleware extremely easy:\nrequire 'sinatra/base'\n\nuse Sinatra do\n  get('/') { ... }\nend\n\nrun RailsProject::Application\nScopes and Binding\nThe scope you are currently in determines what methods and variables are\navailable.\nApplication/Class Scope\nEvery Sinatra application corresponds to a subclass of\nSinatra::Base. If you are using the top-level DSL (require\n'sinatra'), then this class is Sinatra::Application,\notherwise it is the subclass you created explicitly. At class level you\nhave methods like get or before, but you cannot access\nthe request object or the session, as there only is a\nsingle application class for all requests.\nOptions created via set are methods at class level:\nclass MyApp < Sinatra::Base\n  # Hey, I'm in the application scope!\n  set :foo, 42\n  foo # => 42\n\n  get '/foo' do\n    # Hey, I'm no longer in the application scope!\n  end\nend\nYou have the application scope binding inside:\n\nYour application class body\n\nMethods defined by extensions\n\nThe block passed to helpers\n\nProcs/blocks used as value for set\n\nThe block passed to Sinatra.new\n\nYou can reach the scope object (the class) like this:\n\nVia the object passed to configure blocks (configure { |c| ... })\n\nsettings from within request scope\n\nRequest/Instance Scope\nFor every incoming request, a new instance of your application class is\ncreated and all handler blocks run in that scope. From within this scope\nyou can access the request and session object or call\nrendering methods like erb or haml. You can access the\napplication scope from within the request scope via the settings\nhelper:\nclass MyApp < Sinatra::Base\n  # Hey, I'm in the application scope!\n  get '/define_route/:name' do\n    # Request scope for '/define_route/:name'\n    @value = 42\n\n    settings.get(\"/#{params[:name]}\") do\n      # Request scope for \"/#{params[:name]}\"\n      @value # => nil (not the same request)\n    end\n\n    \"Route defined!\"\n  end\nend\nYou have the request scope binding inside:\n\nget/head/post/put/delete/options blocks\n\nbefore/after filters\n\nhelper methods\n\ntemplates/views\n\nDelegation Scope\nThe delegation scope just forwards methods to the class scope. However, it\ndoes not behave 100% like the class scope, as you do not have the class\nbinding. Only methods explicitly marked for delegation are available and\nyou do not share variables/state with the class scope (read: you have a\ndifferent self). You can explicitly add method delegations by\ncalling Sinatra::Delegator.delegate :method_name.\nYou have the delegate scope binding inside:\n\nThe top level binding, if you did require \"sinatra\"\n\nAn object extended with the Sinatra::Delegator mixin\n\nHave a look at the code for yourself: here's the Sinatra::Delegator\nmixin being extending\nthe main object.\nCommand Line\nSinatra applications can be run directly:\nruby myapp.rb [-h] [-x] [-e ENVIRONMENT] [-p PORT] [-o HOST] [-s HANDLER]\nOptions are:\n-h # help\n-p # set the port (default is 4567)\n-o # set the host (default is 0.0.0.0)\n-e # set the environment (default is development)\n-s # specify rack server/handler (default is thin)\n-x # turn on the mutex lock (default is off)\nRequirement\nThe following Ruby versions are officially supported:\n Ruby 1.8.7 \n\n1.8.7 is fully supported, however, if nothing is keeping you from it, we\nrecommend upgrading to 1.9.2 or switching to JRuby or Rubinius. Support for\n1.8.7 will not be dropped before Sinatra 2.0 and Ruby 2.0 except maybe for\nthe unlikely event of 1.8.8 being released. Even then, we might continue\nsupporting it. Ruby 1.8.6 is no longer supported. If you want to run\nwith 1.8.6, downgrade to Sinatra 1.2, which will receive bug fixes until\nSinatra 1.4.0 is released.\n Ruby 1.9.2 \n\n1.9.2 is fully supported and recommended. Do not use 1.9.2p0, it is known\nto cause segmentation faults when running Sinatra. Support will continue at\nleast until the release of Ruby 1.9.4/2.0 and support for the latest 1.9\nrelease will continue as long as it is still supported by the Ruby core\nteam.\n Ruby 1.9.3 \n\n1.9.3 is fully supported and recommended. Please note that switching to\n1.9.3 from an earlier version will invalidate all sessions.\n Rubinius \n\nRubinius is officially supported (Rubinius >= 1.2.4), everything,\nincluding all template languages, works. The upcoming 2.0 release is\nsupported as well, including 1.9 mode.\n JRuby \n\nJRuby is officially supported (JRuby >= 1.6.7). No issues with third\nparty template libraries are known, however, if you choose to use JRuby,\nplease look into JRuby rack handlers, as the Thin web server is not fully\nsupported on JRuby. JRuby's support for C extensions is still\nexperimental, which only affects RDiscount, Redcarpet, RedCloth and Yajl\ntemplates as well as Thin and Mongrel at the moment.\n\nWe also keep an eye on upcoming Ruby versions.\nThe following Ruby implementations are not officially supported but still\nare known to run Sinatra:\n\nOlder versions of JRuby and Rubinius\n\nRuby Enterprise Edition\n\nMacRuby, Maglev, IronRuby\n\nRuby 1.9.0 and 1.9.1 (but we do recommend against using those)\n\nNot being officially supported means if things only break there and not on\na supported platform, we assume it's not our issue but theirs.\nWe also run our CI against ruby-head (the upcoming 2.0.0) and the 1.9.4\nbranch, but we can't guarantee anything, since it is constantly moving.\nExpect both 1.9.4p0 and 2.0.0p0 to be supported.\nSinatra should work on any operating system supported by the chosen Ruby\nimplementation.\nYou will not be able to run Sinatra on Cardinal, SmallRuby, BlueRuby or any\nRuby version prior to 1.8.7 as of the time being.\nThe Bleeding Edge\nIf you would like to use Sinatra's latest bleeding code, feel free to\nrun your application against the master branch, it should be rather stable.\nWe also push out prerelease gems from time to time, so you can do a\ngem install sinatra --pre\nTo get some of the latest features.\nWith Bundler\nIf you want to run your application with the latest Sinatra, using Bundler is the recommended way.\nFirst, install bundler, if you haven't:\ngem install bundler\nThen, in your project directory, create a Gemfile:\nsource :rubygems\ngem 'sinatra', :git => \"git://github.com/sinatra/sinatra.git\"\n\n# other dependencies\ngem 'haml'                    # for instance, if you use haml\ngem 'activerecord', '~> 3.0'  # maybe you also need ActiveRecord 3.x\nNote that you will have to list all your applications dependencies in\nthere. Sinatra's direct dependencies (Rack and Tilt) will, however, be\nautomatically fetched and added by Bundler.\nNow you can run your app like this:\nbundle exec ruby myapp.rb\nRoll Your Own\nCreate a local clone and run your app with the sinatra/lib\ndirectory on the $LOAD_PATH:\ncd myapp\ngit clone git://github.com/sinatra/sinatra.git\nruby -Isinatra/lib myapp.rb\nTo update the Sinatra sources in the future:\ncd myapp/sinatra\ngit pull\nInstall Globally\nYou can build the gem on your own:\ngit clone git://github.com/sinatra/sinatra.git\ncd sinatra\nrake sinatra.gemspec\nrake install\nIf you install gems as root, the last step should be\nsudo rake install\nVersioning\nSinatra follows Semantic Versioning, both\nSemVer and SemVerTag.\nFurther Reading\n\nProject Website - Additional\ndocumentation, news, and links to other resources.\n\nContributing - Find a\nbug?

You have recent posts on your blog's index page.  You have\n  an Atom feed.  You have recent posts on your blog's Atom feed.  See where I'm\n  going with this?\n\n  The hAtom microformat (or uformat) can be embedded in your existing HTML by\n  setting CSS classes with semantic meaning inside of your posts.  A class to signify\n  a post is contained within this div, a class to signify the contents of this\n  h3 are the post's title, a class to signify the contents of this span is the\n  blog post's author, etc.\n\n  You can then use a microformat parser (like, say, mofo) to extract this information\n  as you would from an Atom feed.  Hell, you can even convert hAtom to Atom.  It's an\n  insta-feed!  No extra code required!\n\n  You're already doing the work, you see.  Microformats are everywhere.  We just need\n  to set them free.\n\n  Check it:\n\n    <div class=\"post\">\n      <h3>Megadeth Show Last Night</h3>\n      <span class=\"subtitle\">Posted by Chris on June 4th</span>\n      <div class=\"content\">Went to a show last night.  Megadeth.  It was alright.</div>\n    </div>\n\n  Right?  Normal.  Here's the same post marked up with hAtom:\n\n    <div class=\"post hentry\">\n      <h3 class=\"entry-title\">Megadeth Show Last Night</h3>\n      <span class=\"subtitle\">Posted by <span class=\"author vcard fn\">Chris</span> on \n      <abbr class=\"updated\" title=\"2006-06-04T10:32:10Z\">June 4th</abbr></span>\n      <div class=\"content entry-content\">Went to a show last night.  Megadeth.  It was alright.</div>\n    </div>\n\n  All I did was add the hentry, entry-title, and entry-content classes to existing containers.  Then I\n  went ahead and wrapped the date in an <abbr> tag giving it a title in the microformat-standard way.  Finally\n  I put a div around Chris signifying it as the author field of the hEntry and making it a valid hCard by\n  including the vcard and fn classes.  It's really not all that hard.  Did I mess it up?  Maybe, but I'm sure I got\n  close.  And I didn't even use a reference.  Practice.\n\n  How'd we parse this, tho?\n\n    $ irb -rubygems\n    >> require 'mofo'\n    => true\n\n    >> post = HEntry.find 'http://milesofstyle.org/posts/351-megadeth-show-last-night.html'\n    => #<HEntry:0x6db898 ... > \n\n    >> post.entry_title\n    => \"Megadeth Show Last Night\"\n\n    >> post.properties\n    => [\"entry_content\", \"updated\", \"author\", \"entry_title\"]\n\n    >> post.updated\n    => Sun Jun 04 10:32:10 UTC 2006\n\n    >> post.updated.class\n    => Time\n\n    >> post.author\n    => #<HCard:0x6e7b98 @properties=[\"fn\"], @fn=\"Chris\">\n\n    >> post.author.fn\n    => \"Chris\"\n\n    >> post.entry_content\n    => \"Went to a show last night.  Megadeth.  It was alright.\"\n\n  That's, like, stupid easy.  If HEntry.find gets back more than one hEntry, you'll get an array.\n\n= Mofo#find\n\n  Everything revolves around the #find method.  Sound familiar?  Yeah.\n\n    >> Microformat.find \"http://valid-url.com\"\n    >> Microformat.find \"/path/to/existing/file\"\n    >> Microformat.find :text => \"microformat text\"\n\n  Also, #find can be told explicitly to find all (returning an array on failure) or only find\n  the first (returning nil on failure).\n\n    >> Microformat.find :all => \"/existing/file\"\n    => [ array of microformat objects ] \n\n    >> Microformat.find :first => \"/existing/file\"\n    => microformat object\n\n    >> Microformat.find \"/existing/file\"\n    => either an array of objects or just one object\n\n  :all and :first go outside of :text.\n\n    >> Microformat.find :all => { :text => 'mfin text' } \n\n  That's it.  Some microformats take specific options.\n\n= Microformats\n\n  Here are the currently implemented microformats, along with a site you\n  can use them on today.  We want more, better, faster, stat.\n\n  formats:\n  - hCard     [ flickr profiles    ]\n  - hCalendar [ upcoming.org       ]\n  - hReview   [ cork'd reviews     ] \n  - hEntry    [ err the blog posts ]\n  - hResume   [ linkedin.com       ]\n  - xoxo      [ chowhound.com      ]\n  - geo       [ upcoming.org       ]\n  - adr       [ upcoming.org       ]\n  - xfn       [ linkedin.com       ]\n\n  patterns:\n  - rel-tag \n  - rel-bookmark\n  - include-pattern\n\n= Ruby on Rails\n\nmofo doubles as a Rails plugin.  Just drop it into vendor/plugins and you are good to go, with all the \navailable microformat parsers loaded into your application.\n\nmofo classes are YAML and Marshal approved.  This means you can cache them with DRb or memcached, or store\nthem in a session.\n\n= More Info\n\n  >> http://microformats.org/ \n  => \"The homepage, check\"\n  >> http://microformats.org/wiki/\n  => \"The wiki, check\"\n  >> http://blog.labnotes.org/category/microformats/\n  => \"Assaf Arkin knows his MFin' stuff\"\n  >> http://allinthehead.com/\n  => \"Drew McClellan, Microformat wizard\"\n  >> http://mofo.rubyforge.org/\n  => \"mofo HQ\"\n\n= Other Parsers\n\n  >> Scrapi\n  => http://rubyforge.org/projects/scrapi/\n  >> uformats\n  => http://rubyforge.org/projects/uformats\n\n= Contributors\n\n  >> Steve Ivy\n  >> Olle Jonsson\n  >> Christian Carter\n  >> Grant Rodgers\n  >> Denis Defreyne\n  >> Andrew Turner\n  >> Mark Murphy\n\n= Author\n\n  >> Chris Wanstrath\n  => chris[at]ozmm[dot]org\n\n",

It is an Enumerable that returns Git::Diff:DiffFile objects from which you can get per file patches and insertion/deletion statistics.  You can also get total statistics from the Git::Diff object directly.\nGit::Status - returns from a @git.status command.  It is an Enumerable that returns\nGit:Status::StatusFile objects for each object in git, which includes files in the working\ndirectory, in the index and in the repository.  Similar to running 'git status' on the command line to determine untracked and changed files.\nGit::Branches - Enumerable object that holds Git::Branch objects.  You can call .local or .remote on it to filter to just your local or remote branches.\nGit::Remote- A reference to a remote repository that is tracked by this repository.\nGit::Log - An Enumerable object that references all the Git::Object::Commit objects that encompass your log query, which can be constructed through methods on the Git::Log object,\nlike:\n@git.log(20).object(\"some_file\").since(\"2 weeks ago\").between('v2.6', 'v2.7').each { |commit| [block] }\nExamples\nHere are a bunch of examples of how to use the Ruby/Git package.\nRuby < 1.9 will require rubygems to be loaded.\n    require 'rubygems'\nRequire the 'git' gem.\n    require 'git'\nGit env config\n  Git.configure do |config|\n    #

    "Name": "simply_versioned",
    "Readme": "SimplyVersioned\n===============\n\nRelease:    1.0.0\nDate:           28-01-2008\nAuthor:     Matt Mower <self@mattmower.com>\n\nSimplyVersioned is a simple, non-invasive, approach to versioning ActiveRecord models.\n\nSimplyVersioned does not require any structural change to the models to be versioned and requires only one versions table to be created (a migration generator is supplied with the plugin) for the application, regardless of the number of models being versioned.\n\nThe plugin introduces a 'Version' ActiveRecord model (that reflects changes to model attributes) to which versioned models are polymorphically associated. Version records store the model information as a YAML hash.\n\nSimplyVersioned meets a simple need for model versioning. If your needs are more complex maybe try Rick Olsen's acts_as_versioned (http://svn.techno-weenie.net/projects/plugins/acts_as_versioned/).\n\nSimplyVersioned is (so far) actively tested with Rails 2.0.2 and Ruby 1.8.6\n\nUsage\n=====\n\n1. Install the plugin\n\n  ./script/plugin install http://rubymatt.rubyforge.org/svn/simply_versioned\n\n2. Generate the migration\n\n  ./script/generate simply_versioned_migration\n\n    Note that the migration defaults to storing the version info in a TEXT field. On MySQL this will default to a\n    limit of 64K. If you are versioning particularly large models you will want to modify the migration to include\n    a :limit => n condition to promote the yaml column to a MEDIUMTEXT or (god forbid) a LONGTEXT.\n\n3. Create the versions table\n\n  rake db:migrate\n\n4. Annotate the models you want to version specifying how many versions to keep\n\n    class Thing < ActiveRecord::Base\n      simply_versioned :keep => 10\n    end\n\n    If you do not specify a limit then old versions are never automatically deleted. You can\n    manually delete them like this:\n\n    thing.versions.purge( 10 )\n\n    which would delete all the but the last ten versions.\n\n    If you want fine-grained control over when versions are created you can use:\n\n    class Thing < ActiveRecord::Base\n        simply_versioned :automatic => false\n    end\n\n    and new versions will no longer be created by default. You will then need to use\n    the with_versioning method to create a version.\n\n    Lastly you can control which columns will be versioned by specifying an exclude parameter.\n\n    class Thing < ActiveRecord::Base\n        simply_versioned :exclude => :awkward_column\n    end\n\n    or  \n\n    class Thing < ActiveRecord::Base\n        simply_versioned :exclude => [:first_awkward_column,:second_awkward_column,...]\n    end\n\n    This may be helpful if you run into conflicts with other plugins which try to manage columns.\n\n5. Create versions\n\n    thing = Thing.create!( :foo => bar ) # creates v1\n    thing.foo = baz\n    thing.save! # creates v2\n\n    If you need to control whether a version is created or not, use #with_versioning. For example:\n\n    thing.with_versioning( false ) do |t|\n        t.save!\n    end\n\n    or, using the \"magic pen\" (http://dablog.rubypal.com/2007/2/18/the-magic-pens-of-ruby thanks hmj):\n\n    thing.with_versioning( false, &:save! )\n\n6. Find versions\n\n    thing.versions.each do |version| ... end\n    render :partial => 'thing_version', :collection => thing.versions\n    thing.versions.current\n    thing.versions.first\n    thing.versions.get( 3 )\n\n    To find a version number:\n\n    thing.version_number\n\n7. Revert to a previous version\n\n    thing.revert_to_version( 5 )\n\n    If a specific reversion needs to avoid overwriting some column values pass\n    an :except option, e.g.\n\n    thing.revert_to_version( 1, :except => [:name,:age] )\n\n    The revert_to_version method also takes an existing Version instance, e.g.\n\n    version = thing.versions.find( ... )\n    thing.revert_to_version( version )\n\n8. Traverse versions\n\n    thing.versions.current.previous\n    thing.versions.first.next\n\n9. Obtain a copy of a previous versioned model\n\n    thing.versions.first.model # => Instantiated Thing with versioned values\n\nThanks to:\n\n    Chris Wanstrath (http://ozmm.org/) for useful feedback and GitHub\n    Josh Susser (http://blog.hasmanythrough.com/) for useful suggestions and feedback\n    Rick Olson (http://techno-weenie.net/) for all the many plugins whose code i've read\n\nCopyright (c) 2007 Matt Mower <self@mattmower.com> and released under the MIT license\n\n",

    "Readme": "\nIMPORTANT!\nThis Ruby gem is no longer supported and has not been for several years. \nIt is no longer recommended for public use.  Instead I would recommend\nlooking at the officially supported Amazon Ruby SDK provided by Amazon.com.\nSee aws.amazon.com/sdkforruby/\nThanks for your support!\nAmazon Web Services Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) Ruby Gem\nAbout amazon-ec2\nAmazon Web Services offers a compute power on demand capability known as\nthe Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2). The server resources in the cloud can be\nprovisioned on demand by making HTTP Query API calls to EC2.\nThis 'amazon-ec2' Ruby Gem is an interface library that can be used\nto interact with the Amazon EC2 system and control server resources on\ndemand from your Ruby scripts, or from applications written in your Ruby\nframework of choice (Ruby on Rails, Merb, etc.).\nMore recently, support has been added for the following EC2 related AWS\nAPI's as well:\n\nAutoscaling\n\nCloudwatch\n\nElastic Load Balancing (ELB)\n\nRelational Database Service (RDS)\n\nFor the most complete and up-to date README information please visit the\nproject homepage at:\ngithub.com/grempe/amazon-ec2/tree/master\nor the official EC2 website at aws.amazon.com/ec2\nInstallation\nThis gem follows the standard conventions for installation on any system\nwith Ruby and RubyGems installed and uses Bundler for gem installation and\nbuild management.  If you have worked with gems before this will look very\nfamiliar.\nGet an AWS account\nBefore you can make use of this gem you will need an Amazon Web Services\ndeveloper account which you can sign up for at aws-portal.amazon.com/gp/aws/developer/registration/index.html.\nThis account must also be specifically enabled for Amazon EC2 usage.  AWS\nwill provide you with an 'AWS Access Key ID' and a 'Secret\nAccess Key' which will allow you to authenticate any API calls you make\nand ensure correct billing to you for usage of the service.  Take note of\nthese (and keep them secret!).\nInstall the amazon-ec2 gem (Canonical Release)\nThis is the standard install for stable releases from RubyGems.\n# Install the gem\n[sudo] gem install amazon-ec2\nInstall from local Git clone (for amazon-ec2 developers)\nTo install from git for adding features or fixing bugs, you'll need to\nclone and build.\ngit clone git://github.com/grempe/amazon-ec2.git\ncd amazon-ec2\nbundle install\nrake test\nrake build\nrake install\nUsing amazon-ec2\nThe library exposes one main interface class AWS::EC2::Base.  It is through\nan instance of this class that you will perform all the operations for\nusing the EC2 service including query string header signing.\nThe public methods on AWS::EC2::Base closely mirror the EC2 Query API, and\nas such the Query API Reference in the EC2 Developer Guide ( developer.amazonwebservices.com/connect/kbcategory.jspa?categoryID=84\n) will prove helpful.\nSetting up\nThe 'awshell' and 'ec2-gem-example.rb' scripts which will\nbe introduced to you shortly expect your AWS EC2 credentials to be stored\nas shell environment variables which are accessible to those scripts. This\nmakes them convenient to use whenever you need to do a quick query to see\nwhat images you have available to you, what's running now, or to start\nor stop an instance on EC2. You'll find 'awshell' to be a very\nhandy tool. I'll describe only the OS X route for setting up (of course\nthe setup steps will vary depending on your particular system and preferred\nshell). If you don't want to do it this way, feel free to copy these\nscripts from the gem dir to any location where you can run them from and\nmodify them directly to include your credentials.\nEdit the file ~/.bash_login and add the following to the existing contents:\n# OPTIONAL : Why 'export RUBYOPT'? Because we leave loading libs up to you... See : http://gist.github.com/54177\nexport RUBYOPT=\"rubygems\"\n\n# For amazon-ec2 and amazon s3 ruby gems\nexport AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=\"YOUR_ACCESS_KEY_ID\"\nexport AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=\"YOUR_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY_ID\"\nIf you are using EC2 in the EU region, make sure you also set:\nexport EC2_URL=\"https://eu-west-1.ec2.amazonaws.com\"\n(which you have already if you configured standard EC2 command line tools\nto work with this region).\nOnce you save the file you should close and re-open your terminal so the\nnew variables are made available. You'll need to do this close/re-open\nstep for each terminal window you have open (or issue the 'source\n~/.bash_login' command in each). Make sure that this file is only\nreadable by your user so you don't inadvertently expose your\ncredentials to other users on your system.\nYou can verify that this setup is complete by running the 'set' in\na command window and seeing that your credentials are in the list of shell\nvariables.\nThe basics\nThe library exposes one main interface module\nAWS::EC2::Base\nThis method requires arguments which include your AWS credentials and it\nwill return an object that you can use to make method calls directly\nagainst EC2. All the operations for using the EC2 service, including query\nstring header signing, are handled automatically for you. The connection\nstring will look something like this:\n@ec2 = AWS::EC2::Base.new(:access_key_id => ACCESS_KEY_ID, :secret_access_key => SECRET_ACCESS_KEY)\nI've tried to keep the public methods on 'amazon-ec2' as close\nas possible to the AWS EC2 Query API. This similarity allows you to\nreference the Query API Reference in the EC2 Developer Guide and be able to\nget started right away. In most cases the methods names only differ in how\nthey are presented. e.g. 'DescribeImages' becomes\n'#describe_images()' in Ruby. Feel free to browse the full RDoc\ndocumentation for all classes and methods of 'amazon-ec2' if you\nwant more details.\nExamples\nThe best way to become familiar with 'amazon-ec2' is to take it for\na test drive. We have provided a few simple ways to get you started. There\nis also some sample code below that should help out in using\n'amazon-ec2' with a plain Ruby script, or as part of a Ruby on\nRails application.\nUsing the 'ec2-gem-example.rb' sample test script\nAn example Ruby script which exercises the library a bit more is installed\nfor you to check out when you install this gem. You can run this script to\nverify that everything is setup and working correctly in your environment.\nConsult the file which is installed at :\n[your amazon-ec2 gem dir]/examples/ec2-example.rb\nSince we also package this sample file in the gem's bin/ dir you should\nalso be able to run it from anywhere on your shell path (once you have set\nyour environment variables as described above).\nUsing the 'awshell' command shell\nThe 'awshell' command shell is actually a standard 'irb'\nRuby shell, with the main difference being we read your AWS credentials\nfrom your environment and pre-configure a connection string for you. This\nlets you run any EC2 command very simply. This has proven to be a valuable\ntool during the development of this gem and you should try it out. Since we\ninstall this tool in your system path as part of the installation of this\ngem, you should be able to simply run 'awshell' from any terminal\ncommand prompt on your local system. You'll see some basic instructions\nfor use, and a few examples when you start 'awshell'. Go ahead and\ntry it out now. We'll wait\u2026\nIf you're not in front of a terminal shell now (perhaps you're\nbrowsing this site on your iPhone) this is what you would see:\nhostname:/tmp/rails/amazon_test glenn$ awshell\n\n  'awshell' usage :\n  This is an interactive 'irb' command shell that allows you to use all\n  commands available to the amazon-ec2 gem.  You'll find this to be a\n  great tool to help you debug issues and practice running commands\n  against the live EC2 servers prior to putting them in your code.\n\n  The EC2 connection is wired to the class instance '@ec2'.  Make method calls\n  on this to execute commands on EC2.  Adding a #to_s\n  at the end of any command should give you a full String representation of the\n  response.\n\n    Examples to try:\n\n      returns : all ec2 public methods\n      >> @ec2.methods.sort\n\n      returns : a string representation of ALL images\n      >> @ec2.describe_images.to_s\n\n      returns : an Array of AWS::Response objects, each an EC2 image and its data\n      >> @ec2.describe_images.imagesSet.item\n      >> @ec2.describe_images.imagesSet.item[0] (a hash representing a single item in that array)\n      >> @ec2.describe_images.imagesSet.item[0].to_s (a String representation of that item)\n\n>> @ec2.describe_images.imagesSet.item[0].to_s\n=> \"#<AWS::Response:0x100A465B4 imageId=\\\"ami-018e6b68\\\" imageLocation=\\\"rbuilder-online/phonehome-1.5.6-x86_10132.img.manifest.xml\\\" imageOwnerId=\\\"099034111737\\\" imageState=\\\"available\\\" isPublic=\\\"true\\\" parent=#<AWS::Response:0x100A469A6 ...>>\"\nRuby script usage example:\nTry out the following bit of code. This should walk through each image\nreturned by a call to #describe_images and print out its key data. Note in\nthe example below that you cannot walk through the results of the\n#describe_images call with the '.each' iterator (You'll get\nerrors if you try). You need to instead walk through the Array of items\nwhich are in the 'imagesSet' embedded in the response. This\nreflects exactly the XML hierarchy of data returned from EC2 which we parse\nto Ruby OpenStruct objects (AWS::Response).\n#!/usr/bin/env ruby\n\nrequire 'rubygems'\nrequire 'AWS'\n\nACCESS_KEY_ID = '--YOUR AWS ACCESS KEY ID--'\nSECRET_ACCESS_KEY = '--YOUR AWS SECRET ACCESS KEY--'\n\nec2 = AWS::EC2::Base.new(:access_key_id => ACCESS_KEY_ID, :secret_access_key => SECRET_ACCESS_KEY)\n\nputs \"----- listing images owned by 'amazon' -----\"\nec2.describe_images(:owner_id => \"amazon\").imagesSet.item.each do |image|\n  # OpenStruct objects have members!\n  image.members.each do |member|\n    puts \"#{member} => #{image[member]}\"\n  end\nend\nRuby on Rails usage example:\nRails 2.3.x - config/environment.rb\nRails::Initializer.run do |config|\n ...\n config.gem \"amazon-ec2\", :lib => \"AWS\", :source => \"http://gemcutter.org/\"\n ...\nend\nRails 3.x.x - Gemfile\n...\ngem \"amazon-ec2\", :require => \"AWS\"\napp/controllers/my_controller.rb\n[some controller code ...]\n\nec2 = AWS::EC2::Base.new(:access_key_id => \"YOUR_AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID\", :secret_access_key => \"YOUR_AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY\")\n\n# get ALL public images\n@ec2_images = ec2.describe_images().imagesSet.item\n\n# Get info on all public EC2 images created by the Amazon EC2 team.\n@ec2_images_amazon = ec2.describe_images(:owner_id => \"amazon\").imagesSet.item\n\n[some more controller code ...]\napp/views/my/index.rhtml\n<h1>EC2 Test#index</h1>\n\n<h1>Sample 1 - debug() view</h1>\n\n<%= debug(@ec2_images_amazon) %>\n\n<h1>Sample 2 - Build a table</h1>\n\n<table border='1'>\n  <tr>\n    <th>image.imageId</th>\n    <th>image.imageLocation</th>\n    <th>image.imageOwnerId</th>\n    <th>image.imageState</th>\n    <th>image.isPublic</th>\n  </tr>\n\n  <% for image in @ec2_images_amazon %>\n    <tr>\n      <td><%=h image.imageId %></td>\n      <td><%=h image.imageLocation %></td>\n      <td><%=h image.imageOwnerId %></td>\n      <td><%=h image.imageState %></td>\n      <td><%=h image.isPublic %></td>\n    </tr>\n  <% end %>\n</table>\n\n<h1>Sample 3 - Iterate</h1>\n\n<% @ec2_images_amazon.each do |image| %>\n  <% image.each_pair do |key, value| %>\n    <% unless key == 'parent' %>\n      <%= \"#{key} => #{value}\" %><br />\n    <% end %>\n  <% end %>\n  <br />\n<% end %>\nImportant notes regarding the structure of AWS::Response Objects\nOne of the key benefits of this new version of the library is that all\nresponses from EC2 are bundled up in a real data structure and no longer\nrequire parsing of text. The hash returned is populated directly from the\nXML given to us by EC2 in response to any command we issue. This means that\nfuture changes to the API and what is returned by EC2 will be handled\ntransparently by the gem. This is a huge benefit. What this means though,\nis that you may have to do a little homework on what actually gets returned\nby EC2 as XML. For example, when you make a #describe_images call in\n'awshell' what AWS returns behind the scenes looks like:\n<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<DescribeImagesResponse xmlns=\"http://ec2.amazonaws.com/doc/2007-01-19/\">\n    <imagesSet>\n        <item>\n            <imageId>ami-20b65349</imageId>\n            <imageLocation>ec2-public-images/fedora-core4-base.manifest.xml</imageLocation>\n            <imageState>available</imageState>\n            <imageOwnerId>amazon</imageOwnerId>\n            <isPublic>true</isPublic>\n        </item>\n        <item>\n            <imageId>ami-22b6534b</imageId>\n            <imageLocation>ec2-public-images/fedora-core4-mysql.manifest.xml</imageLocation>\n            <imageState>available</imageState>\n            <imageOwnerId>amazon</imageOwnerId>\n            <isPublic>true</isPublic>\n        </item>\n        <item>\n            <imageId>ami-23b6534a</imageId>\n            <imageLocation>ec2-public-images/fedora-core4-apache.manifest.xml</imageLocation>\n            <imageState>available</imageState>\n            <imageOwnerId>amazon</imageOwnerId>\n            <isPublic>true</isPublic>\n        </item>\n        <item>\n            <imageId>ami-25b6534c</imageId>\n            <imageLocation>ec2-public-images/fedora-core4-apache-mysql.manifest.xml</imageLocation>\n            <imageState>available</imageState>\n            <imageOwnerId>amazon</imageOwnerId>\n            <isPublic>true</isPublic>\n        </item>\n        <item>\n            <imageId>ami-26b6534f</imageId>\n            <imageLocation>ec2-public-images/developer-image.manifest.xml</imageLocation>\n            <imageState>available</imageState>\n            <imageOwnerId>amazon</imageOwnerId>\n            <isPublic>true</isPublic>\n        </item>\n        <item>\n            <imageId>ami-2bb65342</imageId>\n            <imageLocation>ec2-public-images/getting-started.manifest.xml</imageLocation>\n            <imageState>available</imageState>\n            <imageOwnerId>amazon</imageOwnerId>\n            <isPublic>true</isPublic>\n        </item>\n    </imagesSet>\n</DescribeImagesResponse>\nYou can see here the XML the structure that you will need to follow when\nconstructing queries for information and parsing responses from EC2.\nSo, for example, if you wanted to get the image ID of the third image\nlisted in the response above you would need to do:\n>> puts @ec2.describe_images(:owner_id => 'amazon').imagesSet.item[2].imageId\nami-23b6534a\nEC2 will typically return sets of things (imagesSet, reservationSet, etc.)\nwhich we map to ruby Arrays (.imagesSet.item in the example above). If you\nwant to iterate over a response set you will need to iterate over this\narray. The Arrays will typically contain additional AWS::Response objects\nthat represent each individual item. You'll find that you can use the\n'awshell' to help you understand the structure more completely if\nyou try issuing commands there as a way to practice seeing what will be\nreturned and making sure you get exactly what you want.\nHandling Exceptions\nIf for some reason an error occurs when executing a method (e.g. its\narguments were incorrect, or it simply failed) then an exception will be\nthrown.  The exceptions are defined in exceptions.rb as individual classes\nand should match the exceptions that AWS has defined in the API.  If the\nexception raised cannot be identified then a more generic exception class\nwill be thrown.\nThe implication of this is that you need to be prepared to handle any\nexceptions that may be raised by this library in YOUR code with a\n'rescue' clause.  It is up to you to determine how you want to\nhandle these exceptions in your code.\nAdditional Resources\nProject Websites\n\nProject Home : github.com/grempe/amazon-ec2/tree/master\n\nAPI Documentation : rdoc.info/projects/grempe/amazon-ec2\n\nAmazon Web Services : aws.amazon.com\n\nCredits\nThe original code for this library was provided by Amazon Web Services, LLC\nas sample code.

Seguin (wayneeseguin at gmail dot com)\n\n= How it works\n\n  A global logging buffer gets added to the running application.\n  There is a global buffer which is an array of fifo queues.\n  Worker threads are to pop the first element (which is a string) off of a fifo queue and \"process\" it. \n  Processing involves writing the string to disk using non-blocking asynchronous IO\n  Threads will be event based where the event is something being placed in the queue, or the queue non-empty.\n\n= Config\n\n  You can choose the log that the application uses:\n\n  AlogR.new( \"log/app_log.log\" )\n\n  :log specifies the default log\n\n  AlogR.new( :log => \"log/app_log.log\" )\n\n  You may also specify any combination of logs corresponding to the log levels in addition to the default log:\n\n  AlogR.new( :log => \"log/app_log.log\", :error => \"log/error.log\", :debug => \"log/debug.log\")\n\n  where log levels are one of: [ emergency, alert, critical, error, warning, notice, info, debug ] \n\n= Application Usage\n\n  First be sure to setup the logger:\n\n  $alogger = AlogR.new(:log)\n\n  To log a string to either the error log or the default log (depending on your configuration):\n\n  \"Jonnie! You borked it!\".log(:error)\n\nFeature Requests:\n# Be able to specify conditional filters\n\n= Examples\n\n* Example 1\nrequire \"alogr\"\n$logger = AlogR::Logger.new(:log => \"/Users/wayne/projects/ruby/alogr/trunk/log/default.log\")\n\"a test, should go to the logs 10 times\\n\".log.log.log.log.log.log.log.log.log.log\n\n* Example 2\nrequire \"alogr\"\n$logger = AlogR.new(\n:log => \"/Users/wayne/projects/ruby/alogr/trunk/log/production.log\", \n:error => \"/Users/wayne/projects/ruby/alogr/trunk/log/error.log\"\n)\n\n\"(1)this should go to the production log\\n\".log\n\n\"(2)this should go to error log\\n\".log(:error)\n\n\"(3)error\\n\".log :error\n\n\"(4)production\\n\".log :info\n\n\"(5)error\".log :error\n\n\n* Example 3\nrequire \"lib/alogr\"\n$logger = AlogR.new(\n:log => \"/Users/wayne/projects/ruby/alogr/trunk/log/production.log\", \n:error => \"/Users/wayne/projects/ruby/alogr/trunk/log/error.log\",\n:info => \"/Users/wayne/projects/ruby/alogr/trunk/log/info.log\",\n:warning => \"/Users/wayne/projects/ruby/alogr/trunk/log/warning.log\"\n)\n\n\"this should go to info log\".log\n\n\"this should go to error log\".log(:error)\n\n\"this should go to production log\".log(:warning)\n\n\"error\".log :error\n\n\"warning\".log :warning\n\n\"info\".log :info\n\n\"yetanother error\".log :error\n\n* Example 4\nrequire \"lib/alogr\"\n$logger = AlogR.new(\n:log => \"/Users/wayne/projects/ruby/alogr/trunk/log/production.log\", \n:error => \"/Users/wayne/projects/ruby/alogr/trunk/log/error.log\",\n:info => \"/Users/wayne/projects/ruby/alogr/trunk/log/info.log\",\n/paypal => \"/Users/wayne/projects/ruby/alogr/trunk/log/paypal.log\"\n)\n\"this should go to info log\".log\n\"this should go to error log\".log(:error)\n\"this should go to production log\".log(:warning)\n\n* Example 4:\nIf line matches a regexp then sent log/paypal.log as well as production.log\nAlogR.new(:log => \"log/production.log\", /paypal/ => \"log/paypal.log\")\n\nGets logged to both\n{ :something => \"value\", :something_else => \"value\" }.log\n\n\n",

    "Readme": "SimplyVersioned\n===============\n\nRelease:    1.0.0\nDate:           28-01-2008\nAuthor:     Matt Mower <self@mattmower.com>\n\nSimplyVersioned is a simple, non-invasive, approach to versioning ActiveRecord models.\n\nSimplyVersioned does not require any structural change to the models to be versioned and requires only one versions table to be created (a migration generator is supplied with the plugin) for the application, regardless of the number of models being versioned.\n\nThe plugin introduces a 'Version' ActiveRecord model (that reflects changes to model attributes) to which versioned models are polymorphically associated. Version records store the model information as a YAML hash.\n\nSimplyVersioned meets a simple need for model versioning. If your needs are more complex maybe try Rick Olsen's acts_as_versioned (http://svn.techno-weenie.net/projects/plugins/acts_as_versioned/).\n\nSimplyVersioned is (so far) actively tested with Rails 2.0.2 and Ruby 1.8.6\n\nUsage\n=====\n\n1. Install the plugin\n\n  ./script/plugin install http://rubymatt.rubyforge.org/svn/simply_versioned\n\n2. Generate the migration\n\n  ./script/generate simply_versioned_migration\n\n    Note that the migration defaults to storing the version info in a TEXT field. On MySQL this will default to a\n    limit of 64K. If you are versioning particularly large models you will want to modify the migration to include\n    a :limit => n condition to promote the yaml column to a MEDIUMTEXT or (god forbid) a LONGTEXT.\n\n3. Create the versions table\n\n  rake db:migrate\n\n4. Annotate the models you want to version specifying how many versions to keep\n\n    class Thing < ActiveRecord::Base\n      simply_versioned :keep => 10\n    end\n\n    If you do not specify a limit then old versions are never automatically deleted. You can\n    manually delete them like this:\n\n    thing.versions.purge( 10 )\n\n    which would delete all the but the last ten versions.\n\n    If you want fine-grained control over when versions are created you can use:\n\n    class Thing < ActiveRecord::Base\n        simply_versioned :automatic => false\n    end\n\n    and new versions will no longer be created by default. You will then need to use\n    the with_versioning method to create a version.\n\n    Lastly you can control which columns will be versioned by specifying an exclude parameter.\n\n    class Thing < ActiveRecord::Base\n        simply_versioned :exclude => :awkward_column\n    end\n\n    or  \n\n    class Thing < ActiveRecord::Base\n        simply_versioned :exclude => [:first_awkward_column,:second_awkward_column,...]\n    end\n\n    This may be helpful if you run into conflicts with other plugins which try to manage columns.\n\n5. Create versions\n\n    thing = Thing.create!( :foo => bar ) # creates v1\n    thing.foo = baz\n    thing.save! # creates v2\n\n    If you need to control whether a version is created or not, use #with_versioning. For example:\n\n    thing.with_versioning( false ) do |t|\n        t.save!\n    end\n\n    or, using the \"magic pen\" (http://dablog.rubypal.com/2007/2/18/the-magic-pens-of-ruby thanks hmj):\n\n    thing.with_versioning( false, &:save! )\n\n6. Find versions\n\n    thing.versions.each do |version| ... end\n    render :partial => 'thing_version', :collection => thing.versions\n    thing.versions.current\n    thing.versions.first\n    thing.versions.get( 3 )\n\n    To find a version number:\n\n    thing.version_number\n\n7. Revert to a previous version\n\n    thing.revert_to_version( 5 )\n\n    If a specific reversion needs to avoid overwriting some column values pass\n    an :except option, e.g.\n\n    thing.revert_to_version( 1, :except => [:name,:age] )\n\n    The revert_to_version method also takes an existing Version instance, e.g.\n\n    version = thing.versions.find( ... )\n    thing.revert_to_version( version )\n\n8. Traverse versions\n\n    thing.versions.current.previous\n    thing.versions.first.next\n\n9. Obtain a copy of a previous versioned model\n\n    thing.versions.first.model # => Instantiated Thing with versioned values\n\nThanks to:\n\n    Chris Wanstrath (http://ozmm.org/) for useful feedback and GitHub\n    Josh Susser (http://blog.hasmanythrough.com/) for useful suggestions and feedback\n    Rick Olson (http://techno-weenie.net/) for all the many plugins whose code i've read\n\nCopyright (c) 2007 Matt Mower <self@mattmower.com> and released under the MIT license\n\n",

    "Readme": "SwitchPipe 1.05\nBy Peter Cooper\n~~~~ February 10, 2008 (development began January 11, 2008)\nswitchpipe@peterc.org\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nTHE LATEST, CANONICAL DOCUMENTATION FOR SWITCHPIPE IS LOCATED AT:\nhttp://groups.google.com/group/switchpipe/web\n\nTHE DOCUMENTATION BELOW IS INCLUDED MERELY TO HELP IF YOU'RE IN A RUSH OR UNABLE \nTO VISIT THE ONLINE VERSION. IT IS INCOMPLETE, SECTIONS MAY BE INACCURATE, AND \nTHE ONLINE DOCUMENTATION EXPLAINS A LOT MORE AND IS MORE UP TO DATE.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nWHAT IS SWITCHPIPE?\n-------------------\nOnline @ http://groups.google.com/group/switchpipe/web/introduction-overview\n\nSwitchPipe is a proof of concept \"Web application server.\" More accurately,\nit's a Web application process manager and request dispatcher / proxy. Backend \nHTTP-speaking applications (Web applications) do not run directly within\nSwitchPipe, but are loaded into their own processes making SwitchPipe language\nand framework agnostic.\n\nSwitchPipe takes control of, and manages, the backend application processes, \nincluding loading and proxying to multiple instances of each application in a\nround-robin style configuration. As an administrator, you can define the maximum\nnumber of backend processes to run for each app, along with other settings so \nthat you do not exceeded preferred resource limits. SwitchPipe quickly removes\nprocesses that \"break\" or otherwise outlive their welcome. For example, you can\nlet SwitchPipe kill any backend processes that have not been accessed for, say,\n20 seconds. This makes hosting many multiple Rails applications, for example, a\nquick and non-memory demanding process, ideal for shared hosting environments.\n\nSwitchPipe proxies incoming HTTP requests at the TCP level, using information \nextracted from the HTTP request and headers to work out which backend application\nis required to handle the request.\n\nSwitchPipe's goal is to be:\n\n  * super easy to configure\n  * the easiest way to deploy multiple HTTP-talking backend applications\n  * painless in terms of management; no hand-holding of different applications is needed\n  * a permanent daemon that can handle configuration changes in backend apps \"on the fly\"\n  * a reliable solution on Linux and OS/X (and anything POSIX compatible, ideally)\n\n\nQUICK INSTALL / STEPS TO SEEING A QUICK DEMO OF SWITCHPIPE\n----------------------------------------------------------\nOnline @ http://groups.google.com/group/switchpipe/web/installation-instructions\n\nRun the \"demo\" script from SwitchPipe's base directory:\n  # ./script/demo\n\nThe \"demo\" script does everything that the manual process below does, except it runs\nSwitchPipe as a daemon temporarily, does one test request, then closes down and\ncleans up.\n\nOR DO IT \"THE MANUAL WAY\" (preferred by all true hackers)...\n\nInstall dependencies:\n  # sudo gem install daemons eventmachine open4\n\nInstate configuration file:\n  # cp config.yml.example config.yml\n\nMove application configurations for the demo apps into the \"apps\" directory:\n  # mv demo_apps/*.yml apps/\n\nRun SwitchPipe as an interactive process:\n  # ./script/switchpipe run\n\nVisit these URLs in a browser:\n  http://127.0.0.1:10000/webrick_thing/\n  http://127.0.0.1:10000/python_http_server/ (won't run unless Python is installed)\n  http://127.0.0.1:10000/camping_demo_app/ (won't run unless Camping is installed)\n\nYou should notice SwitchPipe start and manage the relevant processes, killing them\nwhenever the timeouts kick in. Use CTRL+C to break out of SwitchPipe's non-daemonized\nmode. In future use ./script/switchpipe start and ./script/switchpipe stop to start\nand stop SwitchPipe as a daemonized process.\n\nInformation about setting up SwitchPipe as a system service in /etc/init.d, etc, is\navailable within SwitchPipe's online documentation.\n\n\nTHE KEY STEPS TO GETTING STARTED FOR YOUR OWN APPS\n--------------------------------------------------\nOnline @ http://groups.google.com/group/switchpipe/web/setting-up-your-own-webapps-with-switchpipe\n(significantly more up to date than this)\n\n1) Put YAML files into /apps\n    Example for Rails:\n        path: /Users/peter/dev/rails/app1\n        type: mongrel_rails\n        max_instances: 6\n        timeout: 60\n\n    Example for WEBrick / regular app:\n        path: demo_apps\n        cmd: ruby webrick_thing [[PORT]]\n        single_threaded: false\n\n    Example for Camping:\n        path: demo_apps\n        cmd: camping -p [[PORT]] camping_demo.rb\n        max_instances: 1\n        timeout: 15\n\n2) Make sure config.yml exists, by copying config.yml.example to config.yml and tweaking.\n\n3) Run ./script/switchpipe run  \n   Note: This runs it as a regular process, not daemonized.\n         To daemonize use ./script/switchpipe start and ./script/switchpipe stop\n\n4) Make your main HTTP server (Apache / Nginx / whatever) proxy requests to SwitchPipe at directories with the same name as the YAML files you made.\n    Example: If your YAML file is some_rails_app.yml, then proxy to http://switchpipe-host.example.com/some_rails_app/\n             If your YAML file is acampingapp.yml, then proxy to http://switchpipe-host.example.com/acampingapp/\n\n    mod_proxy / <VirtualHost> example:\n             ProxyPass / http://127.0.0.1:10000/rails_app_name/\n             ProxyPassReverse / http://127.0.0.1:10000/rails_app_name/\n\n    .htaccess example (useful so that Apache can serve static files!):\n             RewriteEngine On\n             RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f\n             RewriteRule ^(.*)$ http://127.0.0.1:10000/rails_app_name/$1 [P]\n\n5) Enjoy watching the output of SwitchPipe as it starts and stops backend processes as you access the different apps.\n\n\nEXAMPLE OF ADDING AN APPLICATION\n--------------------------------\nOnline @ http://groups.google.com/group/switchpipe/web/setting-up-your-own-webapps-with-switchpipe\n\nLet's say you've developed a Rails application and you want SwitchPipe to manage it. Just \ncreate a new YAML file in /apps called rails_app_name.yml (or anything, but the base name\nof the file name is used as the app's identifier), and drop in a few lines like so:\n\npath: /path/to/the/rails/app\ntype: mongrel_rails\nmax_instances: 6\ntimeout: 8\n\nRestart SwitchPipe, or merely wait a few seconds until it picks up the new file itself, and\nthe application is made available, with up to six backend processes, in seconds at\na directory just off of SwitchPipe's main URL. For example: http://switchpipe/rails_app_name\n\nYou can deploy Camping, Merb, or even plain old WEBrick apps in the same way. As long\nas it can be run at a prompt, given a specific port to run on, and talk HTTP, SwitchPipe will\ndeploy it. That goes for Ruby and non-Ruby apps.\n\nTo complete the setup, you would then configure your normal Apache, nginx, or other\nmain HTTP daemon to forward requests to a particular domain / virtual host / directory\nthrough to SwitchPipe at the relevant folder. For example, from Apache <Virtualhost>\ndirectives:\n\n  ProxyPass / http://127.0.0.1:10000/rails_app_name/\n  ProxyPassReverse / http://127.0.0.1:10000/rails_app_name/\n\nAn even better way to do it, if possible, is from a .htaccess file. Example:\n\n  RewriteEngine On\n  RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f\n  RewriteRule ^(.*)$ http://127.0.0.1:10000/rails_app_name/$1 [P]\n\nThe benefit of this technique is that static files can be served up by Apache at usual\nbreakneck speed!\n\nNo more port numbers. No more setting up individual clusters for different apps. No\nmore worrying about how different frameworks handle clustering. Hurrah!\n\nNote that a \"hostname\" config variable can also be used on applications to serve up the\napplication through SwitchPipe DIRECTLY. This means you can serve up apps WITHOUT Apache\nor Nginx in front of SwitchPipe!\n\n\nTO DOS\n------\nOnline @ http://groups.google.com/group/switchpipe/web/todos-limitations\n\n * Improve error handling\n * Web-accessible status / information URL\n * Caching (potentially)\n * Test suite\n * Test SwitchPipe on more platforms and architectures (OS X and Linux on i386/686 tested so far)\n * Improve documentation and Web site\n * Stream HTTP message bodies over a certain size to backend apps rather than buffer the whole lot in SwitchPipe\n   (this becomes a necessity when dealing with huge HTTP uploads, say)\n\nCONTRIBUTORS\n------------\n\n - Peter Cooper is / was the primary developer of SwitchPipe (so far).\n - Jason Stirk provided a key patch in April 2008 that resolved hanging issues.\n - Mike Auclair provided a fix so that trailing slashes are not necessary on app names\n\n\"LICENSE\"\n---------\nOnline @ http://groups.google.com/group/switchpipe/web/licensing-information\n\nThis work is hereby released into the Public Domain.

    "Readme": "=================\nWelcome to eBay4R\n=================\n\n:Author: Garry Dolley\n:Date: 03-28-2008\n:Version: v1.1\n:eBay API: 583\n\neBay4R is a Ruby wrapper for eBay's Web Services SOAP API (v583). Emphasis is\non ease of use and small footprint.\n\nPlease report bugs and other problems, see \"Author\" section at the bottom.\n\nCurrent release can be downloaded from:\n\nhttp://rubyforge.org/projects/ebay4r\n\nThe latest code is available at both RubyForge and GitHub:\n\n  * git://rubyforge.org/ebay4r.git\n  * git://github.com/up_the_irons/ebay4r.git\n\n\nRequirements\n------------\n\n* SOAP4R library v1.5.7 or newer.  The specific version I'm using for testing\n  is soap4r-1.5.7.90.20070921.\n\n\nOptionals\n---------\n\n* RubyGems\n\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\ntar/gzip\n~~~~~~~~\n\nJust unzip the archive anywhere you like, and see \"Getting Started\" below \n(you will need to add the ebay4r/lib path to your $RUBYLIB environment\nvariable)\n\nRubyGems\n~~~~~~~~\n\n* To install a gem you already downloaded::\n\n    gem install ebay-<version>.gem\n\n* For the latest release with no fuss (previous download not required)::\n\n    gem install -r ebay\n\nGit\n~~~\n\nYou can download the latest and greatest code using Git, just type::\n\n  git clone git://github.com/up_the_irons/ebay4r.git\n\n\nImportant Note about Using eBay4R and Ruby on Rails\n---------------------------------------------------\n\nIf you installed SOAP4R as a gem you must put the following two lines at the\nvery top of your config/environment.rb::\n\n  require 'rubygems'\n  gem 'soap4r'\n\nThis must be done before Rails starts auto-loading things.\n\nAdditionally, you have to put those two lines in *every* Rails app you have\non your machine, even if it doesn't use SOAP4R!  This is, allegedly, because\nActiveSupport (in dependency.rb) wrongly loads the SOAP4R included with Ruby\ninstead of your Gem.  More details can be found here:\n\n  http://dev.ctor.org/soap4r/ticket/433\n\nIf you get this error, or similar, in every Rails app::\n\n  [...]/activesupport-1.4.2/lib/active_support/dependencies.rb:477:in `const_missing': uninitialized constant XSD::NS::KNOWN_TAG (NameError?)\n\nyou've hit this problem.\n\n\nGetting Started\n---------------\n\nIf you installed eBay4R from a tarball or git repo, you will want to add the\nebay4r/lib directory to your Ruby include path ($RUBYLIB).  Then put\n\n::\n\n  require 'eBayAPI'\n\nat the top of your programs.\n\nIf you installed eBay4R with RubyGems, you don't have to add anything to\nRuby's include path, just put\n\n::\n\n  require 'rubygems'\n  gem 'ebay'\n\nat the top of your programs.\n\nExamples\n--------\n\nLook at the examples/ directory.  Edit the file myCredentials.rb and insert\nthe appropriate values.  Then you can run any of the example programs.\n\nHello, World!\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nThe simplest eBay API call is \"GeteBayOfficialTime\".  Here's how to call it\nwith eBay4R::\n\n  require 'rubygems'\n  gem 'ebay'\n\n  # Put your credentials in this file\n  load('myCredentials.rb')\n\n  # Create new eBay caller object.  Omit last argument to use live platform.\n  eBay = EBay::API.new($authToken, $devId, $appId, $certId, :sandbox => true)\n\n  resp = eBay.GeteBayOfficialTime\n\n  puts \"Hello, World!\"\n  puts \"The eBay time is now: #{resp.timestamp}\"\n\n  # Wasn't that easy?!\n\nAdding an Item\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nThis is a more complex example that performs a real (useful) function::\n\n  require 'rubygems'\n  gem 'ebay'\n\n  load('myCredentials.rb')\n\n  eBay = EBay::API.new($authToken, $devId, $appId, $certId, :sandbox => true)\n\n  # Notice how we nest hashes to mimic the XML structure of an AddItem request\n  resp = eBay.AddItem(:Item => EBay.Item(:PrimaryCategory => EBay.Category(:CategoryID => 57882),\n                                         :Title => 'Mouse Pad',\n                                         :Description => 'A really cool mouse pad, you know you want it...',\n                                         :Location => 'On Earth',\n                                         :StartPrice => '12.0',\n                                         :Quantity => 1,\n                                         :ListingDuration => \"Days_7\",\n                                         :Country => \"US\",\n                                         :Currency => \"USD\",\n                                         :PaymentMethods => [\"VisaMC\", \"PersonalCheck\"]))\n\n  puts \"New Item #\" + resp.itemID + \" added.\"\n\n\nDon't worry too much about EBay.Item and EBay.Category calls for now, they are\nexplained in the \"Creating Complex Data Types\" section below.\n\n\nFormat of Requests\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nIf ``eBay`` is your caller object, then you can issue any eBay API call\nby doing::\n\n  eBay.<call_name>( ... hash of named-arguments ... )\n\nFor example, to issue the GetItem call for Item #4503432058 and return all\ninformation, you do::\n\n  eBay.GetItem(:DetailLevel => 'ReturnAll', :ItemID => '4503432058')\n\nor to see your last invoice using the GetAccount call, you do::\n\n  eBay.GetAccount(:AccountHistorySelection => 'LastInvoice')\n\nSee the \"eBay Web Services SOAP API Guide\" for acceptable parameters and values\nfor each API call.  This guide can be downloaded at eBay's \n`SOAP Development Center <http://developer.ebay.com/soap/>`_.\n\nCreating Complex Data Types\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nA number of elements in eBay's schema are XML Schema simple types.  For\nexample, CategoryID, Title, and Description are all strings.  But many \nelements, like Item and Seller, are of types \"ItemType\" and \"SellerType\", \nrespectively.  These are complex data types, meaning they are structures\ncomposed of collections of simple types.\n\n\"How do I make a complex type object?\", you ask.  Simple::\n\n  EBay.<element_name>( ... hash of named-arguments ... )\n\ncreates a new `<element_name>` element of type ``<element_name>Type``.  For\nexample,\n\n::\n\n  EBay.Item(:Title => 'Mouse Pad', :Description => '...')\n\ncreates a new ``ItemType`` object.  Please note, these factory methods are class\nmethods of module EBay, so the upper-case \"E\" in \"EBay\" is not a typo.  A\nmore common way to see this is::\n\n  EBay::Item( ... )\n\nThe only difference is if you do not pass any arguments to the factory method\nand do not explicitly put empty parentheses (), Ruby will assume it is a \nconstant, not a method.\n\nSetting XML Attributes\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nThe symbol you use to set an XML attribute on an element is::\n\n  :xmlattr_<attribute_name>\n\nFor example, to create a <Label> element (corresponding to eBay's LabelType)\nwith an attribute of \"visible\" equal to \"true\", you would do::\n\n  EBay.Label(:Name => \"some string\", :xmlattr_visible => true)\n\n\nFormat of Responses\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nThere is a one-to-one correspondence between the XML returned by eBay and the\nway you access the values contained therein using the response object returned\nby the call.  For example, let's say you issued a \"GetItem\" call::\n\n  resp = eBay.GetItem(:DetailLevel => 'ReturnAll', :ItemID => '4503432058')\n\nand eBay returned the following XML (abbreviated where appropriate)::\n\n  <?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\n  <soapenv:Envelope xmlns:soapenv=\"http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/envelope/\" \n                    xmlns:xsd=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema\" \n                    xmlns:xsi=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\">\n   <soapenv:Body>\n    <GetItemResponse xmlns=\"urn:ebay:apis:eBLBaseComponents\">\n     <Timestamp>2005-12-09T09:40:41.602Z</Timestamp>\n     <Ack>Success</Ack>\n     <Version>437</Version>\n     <Build>e437_core_Bundled_2119808_R1</Build>\n     <Item>\n      ...\n\n      <AutoPay>false</AutoPay>\n      <BuyerProtection>ItemIneligible</BuyerProtection>\n      <BuyItNowPrice currencyID=\"USD\">0.0</BuyItNowPrice>\n      <Country>US</Country>\n      <Currency>USD</Currency>\n      <Description>Fund. of Physics, 5th, by Halliday, Resnick, Walker</Description>\n      <Escrow>None</Escrow>\n      <GiftIcon>0</GiftIcon>\n      ...\n\n      <ShipToLocations>US</ShipToLocations>\n      <ShipToLocations>CA</ShipToLocations>\n     </Item>\n    </GetItemResponse>\n   </soapenv:Body>\n  </soapenv:Envelope>\n\n\nThe \"resp\" object is of type\n\n  SOAP::Mapping::Object\n\nand contains all the XML elements between ``<GetItemResponse> ... </GetItemResponse>``.\n\nSo, if you want to print the item description, just do::\n\n  puts resp.item.description\n\nand you will see::\n\n  \"Fund. of Physics, 5th, by Halliday, Resnick, Walker\"\n\nRepeated XML elements automatically become arrays of the same name, so to see\nall the locations this item can ship to, just do::\n\n  resp.item.shipToLocations.each { |loc| puts loc }\n\nand you will see::\n\n  US\n  CA\n\nIt's that easy! (Are any Java or C# developers reading this?  Don't be\njealous... ;)\n\nA Note about Case\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nAstute readers (all of you, right?) will notice that the first letter of every\nelement contained within the response object is lower-case, even though in the\nXML it is upper-case.  This is currently the way things are and you will have\nto remember to lower the first character in your code.  \n\nRuby's convention is that only classes, modules, and constants begin with \nupper-case letters.  The author of the SOAP4R library (which contains \nwsdl2ruby.rb) respected this convention, and as a result, the eBay.rb \nfile I use (generated from eBay's WSDL) has this mapping.\n\nI haven't come up with any Ruby magic to dynamically allow upper-case first\ncharacters to work also, so if you happen to want to take a crack at it and\nget it working, please send me your patches (see \"Author\" section at the \nbottom).\n\nPlease note, the opposite does _not_ apply.  That is, you can *submit* a call\nusing either case of the first character, and your arguments can also have\neither case letter first.  For example, this::\n\n  resp = eBay.GetItem(:DetailLevel => 'ReturnAll', :ItemID => '4503432058')\n\nis the same as::\n\n  resp = eBay.getItem(:detailLevel => 'ReturnAll', :itemID => '4503432058')\n\n\nDebugging\n---------\n\nIf \"eBay\" is your eBay caller object, as in::\n\n  eBay = EBay::API.new( ... )\n\nYou can see XML wiredumps by doing::\n\n  eBay.debug = true\n\nbefore you issue any eBay API calls.  This is useful to see the raw XML of\nwhat eBay is sending back to you.\n\n\nFiles\n-----\n\ncontrib/\n  Extras contributed by the community (myself included)\n\nexamples/\n  Examples of eBay API calls using this library.

This is in contrast to including\na reference to a packaged version of an external library that is available in a\nbinary artifact repository such as Maven Central, RubyGems or NPM.\nVendoring is useful when you need to patch or customize the external libraries\nor the external library is expected to co-evolve with the main project. The\ndeveloper can make changes to the main project and patch the library in a single\ncommit.\nThe problem arises when the external library makes changes that you want to\nintegrate into your local vendored version or the developer makes changes to the\nlocal version that they want integrated into the external library.\nA typical \"implementation\" of vendoring is to simply download or checkout the\nsource for the external library, remove the .git or .svn directories and\ncommit it to the main source tree. However this approach makes it very difficult\nto update the library. When you want to update the library do you re-apply your\nlocal changes onto a new copy of the vendored library or do you re-apply the\nchanges from the external library to local version? Both cases involve manual\ngeneration and application of patch files to source trees.\nThis is where Braid comes into play. Braid makes it easy to vendor in remote git\nrepositories and use an automated mechanism for updating the external library\nand generating patches to upgrade the external library.\nBraid creates a file .braids in the root of your repository that contains\nreferences to external libraries or mirrors. There are two types of mirrors in\nBraid: squashed and full. Mirrors are squashed by default, which is what you'll\ngenerally want because they're faster and don't pollute your history with\ncommits from the mirrors.\nFull mirrors are useful when you want to view imported history in your own\nproject. You usually want this if the mirror is also a repository you have\naccess to, for example, when using shared code across projects.\nPlease note that you cannot change between mirror types after the initial add.\nYou'll have to remove the mirror and add it again.\nInstallation\ngem install braid\n\nQuick usage - ruby project\nLet's assume we're writing the project myproject that needs grit in lib/grit. Initialize the repo (nothing braid related here):\ngit init myproject\ncd myproject\ntouch README\ngit add README\ngit commit -m \"initial commit\"\n\nNow let's vendor grit:\nbraid add git://github.com/mojombo/grit.git lib/grit\n\nAnd you're done! Braid vendored grit into lib/grit. Feel free to inspect the changes with git log or git show.\nIf further down the line, you want to bring new changes from grit into your repository, just update the mirror:\nbraid update lib/grit\n\nIf you make changes to the grit library and want to generate a patch file so that you can submit the patch file\nto the grit project:\nbraid diff lib/grit > grit.patch\n\nOnce those changes have been applied to grit you probably want to update your local version of grit again.\nbraid update lib/grit\n\nMore usage\nUse the built in help system to find out about all commands and options:\nbraid help\nbraid help add # or braid add --help\n\nExamples\nAdding a mirror\nbraid add git://github.com/rails/rails.git vendor/rails\n\nAdding mirrors with revisions\nbraid add --revision bf1b1e0 git://github.com/rails/rails.git vendor/rails\n\nAdding mirrors with full history\nbraid add --full git://github.com/mislav/will_paginate.git vendor/plugins/will_paginate\n\nUpdating mirrors\n# Update a specific mirror\nbraid update vendor/plugins/cache_fu\n# Update all mirrors\nbraid update\n\nUpdating mirrors with conflicts\nIf a braid update creates a conflict, braid will stop execution and leave the partially committed\nfiles in your working copy, just like a normal git merge conflict would.\nYou will then have to resolve all conflicts and manually run git commit. The commit message is\nalready prepared.\nIf you want to cancel the braid update and the merge, you'll have to reset your working copy and\nindex with git reset --hard.\nLocking and unlocking mirrors\nbraid update --revision 6c1c16b vendor/rails\nbraid update --head vendor/rails\n\nShowing local changes made to mirrors\nbraid diff vendor/rails\n\nContributing\nWe appreciate any patches, error reports and usage ideas you may have. Please\nsubmit an issue or pull request on GitHub.\nSubversion\nWhile preparing to release Braid v1.0 the support for subversion repositories was removed as\nthere was no active maintainers and inadequate test coverage. If there is anyone motivated to\nre-add and maintain the Subversion support, please contact the authors.\nAuthors\n\nCristi Balan\nNorbert Crombach\nPeter Donald\n\nContributors (alphabetically)\n\nAlan Harper\nBrad Durrow\nChristoph Sturm\nDennis Muhlestein\nFerdinand Svehla\nMichael Klishin\nRoman Heinrich\nTravis Tilley\nTyler Rick\n\n",

    "Name": "uploadcolumn",
    "Readme": "= UploadColumn\n\nUploadColumn is a plugin for the Ruby on Rails framework that enables easy uploading of files, especially images.\n\nSuppose you have a list of users, and you would like to associate a picture to each of them. You could upload the image to a database, or you could use upload_column for simple storage to the file system.\n\nAssuming you have a User model with a column called 'picture' that is of type String, you could simply add the upload_column instruction to your User model:\n\n    class User < ActiveRecord::Base\n      upload_column :picture\n    end\n\nThat's it! You can start uploading files. Of course, +upload_column+ has a lot of different options you can use to customize your uploads.\n\nUploading files is no fun without a user interface, so get going and make one:\n\nadd an upload_column_field to your form, maybe like this:\n\n    <p><label for=\"user_picture\">Picture</label><br/>\n    <%= upload_column_field 'user', 'picture'  %></p>\n\nYou should use upload_column_field instead of Rails' file_field, since it will work even when the form is redisplayed, like when a validation fails. Unfortunately file_field doesn't work in that case.\n\nNow that's excellent, but most likely it will fail, because instead of sending the file, it just sends a string. No worries though, if we just set the form's encoding to multipart it will all work out, UploadColumn even comes with some nice helpers to avoid that nasty multipart syntax. This could look something like this:\n\n    <%= upload_form_tag( :action => 'create' ) %>\n\nAnd that's it! Your uploads are up and running (hopefully) and you should now be able to add pictures to your users. The madness doesn't stop there of course!\n\n== Storage Path\n\nYou won't always want to store the pictures in the directory that upload_column selects for you, but that's not a problem, because changing that directory is trivial. You can pass a <tt>:store_dir</tt> key to the upload_column declaration, this will override the default mechanism and always use that directory as the basis.\n\n    upload_column :picture, :store_dir => \"pictures\"\n\nmight be sensible in our case. Note that this way, all files will be stored in the same directory.\n\nIf you need more refined control over the storage path (maybe you need to store it by the id of an association?) then you can use a proc instead. Our proc might look like this:\n\n    upload_column :picture, :store_dir => proc{|record, file| \"images/#{record.category.name}/#{record.id}/#{file.extension}\"}\n\nThe proc will be passed two parameters, the first is the current instance of your model class, the second is the name of the attribute that is being uploaded to (in our case +attr+ would be <tt>:picture</tt>).\n\nYou can change the <tt>:tmp_dir</tt> in the same way.\n\n== Filename\n\nBy default, UploadColumn will keep the name of the original file, however this might be inconvenient in some cases. You can pass a :filename directive to your upload_column declaration:\n\n    upload_column :picture, :filename => \"donkey.png\"\n\nIn which case all files will be named +donkey.png+. This is not desirable if the file in question is a jpeg file of course. Usually it is more sensible to pass a Proc to :filename.\n\n    upload_column :picture, :filename => proc{|record, file| \"avatar#{record.id}.#{file.extension}\"}\n\nThe Proc will be passed two parameters, the current instance, and the file itself.\n\n== Manipulators\n\nUploadColumn allows you to use manipulators on your file, that in some way transform your file, or perform any kind\nof operations on it. There are currently two manipulators bundled, the RMagick manipulator and the ImageScience\nmanipulator, but writing your own is very easy. There are further instructions on the website.\n\n== Manipulating Images with RMagick\n\nSay you would want (for whatever reason) to have a funky solarize effect on your users' images. Manipulating images with upload_column can be done either at runtime or after the image is saved, let's look at some possibilities:\n\n    class User < ActiveRecord::Base\n      upload_column :picture, :manipulator => UploadColumn::Manipulators::RMagick\n\n      def picture_after_assign\n\n        picture.process! do |img|\n          img.solarize\n        end\n\n      end\n    end\n\nYou can also use the :process instruction, which will automatically apply the manipulation when a new image is uploaded. If you wanted to resize your image to a maximum of 800 by 600 pixels for example, you could do:\n\n    class User < ActiveRecord::Base\n      upload_column :picture, :process => '800x600', :manipulator => UploadColumn::Manipulators::RMagick\n    end\n\nthe previous example with solarize could be written shorter as:\n\n    class User < ActiveRecord::Base\n      upload_column :picture, :process => proc{|img| img.solarize }, :manipulator => UploadColumn::Manipulators::RMagick\n    end\n\nOr maybe we want different versions of our image, then we could simply specify:\n\n    class User < ActiveRecord::Base\n      upload_column :picture, :versions => [ :solarized, :sepiatoned ], :manipulator => UploadColumn::Manipulators::RMagick\n\n      def picture_after_assign\n        picture.solarized.process! do |img|\n          img.solarize\n        end\n        picture.sepiatoned.process! do |img|\n          img.sepiatone\n        end\n      end\n    end\n\nyou can also use a Hash for versions and pass a dimension or a proc to it, so you can do:\n\n    class User < ActiveRecord::Base\n      upload_column :picture, :versions => { :thumb => \"c100x100\", :large => \"200x300\", :sepiatoned => proc{ |img| img.sepiatone } }, :manipulator => UploadColumn::Manipulators::RMagick\n    end\n\nNote the 'c' in front of the dimensions for the thumb image, this will crop the image to the exact dimensions. All of this is a bit wordy though, and it also doesn't take check, that the files really are images. Sepiatoning the latest GreenDay song somehow doesn't sound too good. For that reason UploadColumn comes with the image_column function:\n\n    class User < ActiveRecord::Base\n      image_column :picture, :versions => { :thumb => \"c100x100\", :large => \"200x300\", :sepiatoned => proc{ |img| img.sepiatone } }\n    end\n\nThis also puts your images in public/images instead of public, which is neat!\n\n== Runtime rendering\n\nYou can manipulate images at runtime (it's a huge performance hit though!). In your controller add an action and use UploadColumnRenderHelper.render_image.\n\n    def sepiatone\n      @user = User.find(parms[:id])\n      render_image @user.picture do |img|\n        img.sepiatone\n      end\n    end\n\nAnd that's it!\n\nIn your view, you can use UploadColumnHelper.image to easily create an image tag for your action:\n\n    <%= image :action => \"sepiatone\", :id => 5 %>\n\n== Views\n\nIf your uploaded file is an image you would most likely want to display it in your view, if it's another kind of file you'll want to link to it. Both of these are easy using UploadColumn::BaseUploadedFile.url.\n\n    <%= link_to \"Guitar Tablature\", @song.tab.url %>\n\n    <%= image_tag @user.picture.url %>\n\n== Magic Columns\n\nUploadColumn allows you to add 'magic' columns to your model, which will be automatically filled with the appropriate data. Just add the column, for example via migrations:\n\n    add_column :users, :picture_content_type\n\nAnd if our model looks like this:\n\n    class User < ActiveRecord::Base\n      upload_column :picture\n    end\n\nThe column <tt>picture_content_type</tt> will now automatically be filled with the file's content-type (or at least with UploadColumn's best guess ;).\n\nYou can use any method method on UploadColumn::UploadedFile that takes no argument, so you can use for example, size, url, store_dir and so on.\n\nYou can also do <tt>picture_exif_date_time</tt> or <tt>picture_exif_model</tt>, etc. This works only, of course, if the uploaded file is a JPEG image, since that is the only filetype that has exif data. This requires the EXIFR library, which you can get by installing the gem via <tt>gem install exifr</tt>.\n\n== Validations\n\nUploadColumn comes with its own validation method, validates_integrity_of. This method will ensure that only files with an extension from a whitelist will be uploaded. This prevents a hacker from uploading executable files (such as .rb, .pl or .cgi for example) or it can be used to restrict what kind of file are allowed to be uploaded, for example only images. You can customize the whitelist with the :extensions parameter to upload column.\n\nIf you want to only allow the upload of XHTML and XML files, so you can manipulate them with XSLT you could do:\n\n    upload_column :xml, :extensions => %w(xml html htm), :manipulator => MyXSLTProcessor\n\n    validate_integrity_of :xml\n\nYou can also use some of Rails' validations with UploadColumn.\n\nvalidates_presence_of and validates_size_of have been verified to work. \n\n    validates_size_of :image, :maximum => 200000, :message => \"is too big, must be smaller than 200kB!\"\n\nRemember to change the error message, the default one sounds a bit stupid with UploadColumn.\n\nvalidates_uniqueness_of does NOT work, this is because validates_uniqueness_of will send(:your_upload_column) instead of asking for the instance variable, thus it will get an UploadedFile object, which it can't really compare to other values in the database, this is rather difficult to work around without messing with Rails internals (if you manage, please let me know!). Meanwhile you could do\n\n    validates_each :your_upload_column do |record, attr, value|    \n      record.errors.add attr, 'already exists!' if YourModel.find( :first, :conditions => [\"#{attr.to_s} = ?\", value ] )\n    end\n\nIt's not elegant I know, but it should work.\n\n",

    "Readme": "= Rack, a modular Ruby webserver interface\n\nRack provides a minimal, modular and adaptable interface for developing\nweb applications in Ruby.  By wrapping HTTP requests and responses in\nthe simplest way possible, it unifies and distills the API for web\nservers, web frameworks, and software in between (the so-called\nmiddleware) into a single method call.\n\nThe exact details of this are described in the Rack specification,\nwhich all Rack applications should conform to.\n\n== Supported web servers\n\nThe included *handlers* connect all kinds of web servers to Rack:\n* Mongrel\n* EventedMongrel\n* WEBrick\n* FCGI\n* CGI\n* SCGI\n* LiteSpeed\n\nThese web servers include Rack handlers in their distributions:\n* Ebb\n* Fuzed\n* Thin\n\nAny valid Rack app will run the same on all these handlers, without\nchanging anything.\n\n== Supported web frameworks\n\nThe included *adapters* connect Rack with existing Ruby web frameworks:\n* Camping\n\nThese frameworks include Rack adapters in their distributions:\n* Coset\n* Halcyon\n* Maveric\n* Merb\n* Racktools::SimpleApplication\n* Ramaze\n* Sinatra\n* Vintage\n\nRuby on Rails can be run with the adapter included with Thin, which\nwill be merged into a later Rack version.\n\nCurrent links to these projects can be found at\nhttp://ramaze.net/#other-frameworks\n\n== Available middleware\n\nBetween the server and the framework, Rack can be customized to your\napplications needs using middleware, for example:\n* Rack::URLMap, to route to multiple applications inside the same process.\n* Rack::CommonLogger, for creating Apache-style logfiles.\n* Rack::ShowException, for catching unhandled exceptions and\n  presenting them in a nice and helpful way with clickable backtrace.\n* Rack::File, for serving static files.\n* ...many others!\n\nAll these components use the same interface, which is described in\ndetail in the Rack specification.  You can choose to use them exactly\nin the way you want.\n\n== Convenience\n\nIf you want to develop outside of existing frameworks, implement your\nown ones, or develop middleware, Rack provides many helpers to create\nRack applications quickly and without doing the same web stuff all\nover:\n* Rack::Request, which also provides query string parsing and\n  multipart handling.\n* Rack::Response, for convenient generation of HTTP replies and\n  cookie handling.\n* Rack::MockRequest and Rack::MockResponse for efficient and quick\n  testing of Rack application without real HTTP round-trips.\n\n== rackup\n\nrackup is a useful tool for running Rack applications, which uses the\nRack::Builder DSL to configure middleware and build up applications\neasily.\n\nrackup automatically figures out the environment it is run in, and\nruns your application as FastCGI, CGI, or standalone with Mongrel or\nWEBrick---all from the same configuration.\n\n== Quick start\n\nTry the lobster!\n\nEither with the embedded WEBrick starter:\n\n    ruby -Ilib lib/rack/lobster.rb\n\nOr with rackup:\n\n    bin/rackup -Ilib example/lobster.ru \n\nBy default, the lobster is found at http://localhost:9292.\n\n== Installing with RubyGems\n\nA Gem of Rack is available.

But can be used as examples for building other tasks as well.\nRequirements\n\nCapistrano >= 2.2.0\nNOTE: When using a git repository use Capistrano >= 2.5.3.\n\nInstall\nUse your Gemfile and bundler to both document and install the eycap gem to your application.  We also recommend the following gems to be configured along side eycap.  Add these to your Gemfile:\ngroup :development, :test do\n  gem 'eycap', :require => false\n  gem 'capistrano', '~> 2.15'\n  gem 'net-ssh', '~> 2.7.0'\nend\nThen run bundle install to install the eycap and other gem(s).\n$ bundle install\n\nThen in your deploy.rb file you'll need to add the following require statement to the begininng of the file:\nrequire \"eycap/recipes\"\n\nUsage\nConfiguration\nYour initial deploy.rb will be provided for you when your servers are provisioned on Engine Yard Managed.  In order to deploy your application, you can go to the RAILS_ROOT folder and run:\n$ capify .\n\nThis generates the Capfile and the config/deploy.rb file for you.  You'll replace the config/deploy.rb file with the deploy.rb given to you by Engine Yard.\nFor deploying Rails 3.1 or greater apps using the asset pipeline read more on the linked page.\nSetup restart server\nMongrel is the default server, to override this default you'll need to define the following in your deploy.rb file:\nnamespace :deploy do\n\n  task :restart, :roles => :app do\n    # mongrel.restart\n  end\n\n\n  task :spinner, :roles => :app do\n    # mongrel.start\n  end\n\n\n  task :start, :roles => :app do\n    # mongrel.start\n  end    \n\n\n  task :stop, :roles => :app do\n    # mongrel.stop\n  end\n\nend\nReplace the commented out with your server (passenger, unicorn, thin, puma, etc.) and then it will override the default of mongrel.\nDeploying to Environment\nTo ensure your environments are ready to deploy, check on staging.\n$ cap staging deploy:check\n\nThis will determine if all requirements are met to deploy.  Sometimes if the default folders are not setup you may be able to repair by running:\n$ cap staging deploy:setup\n\nIf you cannot get deploy:check to pass, please open a new support ticket and let us know.\nNow you're ready to do a test deploy.\nOptionally, cap deploy:cold will run your migrations and start (instead of restart) your app server.\n$ cap staging deploy:cold\n\nOr if you have already dumped a copy of your data to staging or do not want to run migrations you can simply do a deploy.\n$ cap staging deploy\n\nAnd to do all this on production, just change the environment name and you'll be all set.\n$ cap production deploy\n\nEycap Commands\nFor a list of all available commands, run:\n$ cap -T\n\nThis will show you not only the default capistrano commands but also the ones you get by including the eycap gem.\nCustom binaries path\nIn rare cases (unicorn / sphinx) it is required to set custom path for binaries when using\ndevelopment versions of scripts. It is as easy as:\nset :engineyard_bin, \"/engineyard/custom\"\nThe default is /engineyard/bin and is just fine in normal deployment.\nPull Requests\nIf you'd like to contribute to the eycap gem please create a fork, then send a pull request and a member of the eycap team will review it.\nIssues\nWhen you run into a problem please check the issues to see if one has been reported.  If not, please report the issue and we'll get to work on fixing it.\nLicense\nCopyright (c) Engine Yard\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining\na copy of this software and associated documentation files (the\n\"Software\"), to deal in the Software without restriction, including\nwithout limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish,\ndistribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to\npermit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to\nthe following conditions:\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be\nincluded in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,\nEXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF\nMERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND\nNONINFRINGEMENT.

    "Readme": "== Sequel: Concise ORM for Ruby\n\nSequel is an ORM framework for Ruby. Sequel provides thread safety, connection pooling, and a concise DSL for constructing queries and table schemas.\n\nSequel makes it easy to deal with multiple records without having to break your teeth on SQL.\n\n== Resources\n\n* {Project page}[http://code.google.com/p/ruby-sequel/]\n* {Source code}[http://ruby-sequel.googlecode.com/svn/]\n* {Bug tracking}[http://code.google.com/p/ruby-sequel/issues/list]\n* {Google group}[http://groups.google.com/group/sequel-talk]\n* {RubyForge page}[http://rubyforge.org/projects/sequel/]\n\nTo check out the source code:\n\n  svn co http://ruby-sequel.googlecode.com/svn/trunk\n\n=== Contact\n\nIf you have any comments or suggestions please send an email to ciconia at gmail.com and I'll get back to you.\n\n== Installation\n\n  sudo gem install sequel\n\n== Supported Databases\n\nSequel currently supports:\n\n* ADO (on Windows)\n* DBI\n* Informix\n* MySQL\n* ODBC\n* Oracle\n* PostgreSQL\n* SQLite 3\n\nThere are also experimental adapters for DB2, OpenBase and JDBC (on JRuby).\n\n== The Sequel Console\n\nSequel includes an IRB console for quick'n'dirty access to databases. You can use it like this:\n\n  sequel sqlite:///test.db\n\nYou get an IRB session with the database object stored in DB.\n\n== An Introduction\n\nSequel was designed to take the hassle away from connecting to databases and manipulating them. Sequel deals with all the boring stuff like maintaining connections, formatting SQL correctly and fetching records so you can concentrate on your application.\n\nSequel uses the concept of datasets to retrieve data. A Dataset object encapsulates an SQL query and supports chainability, letting you fetch data using a convenient Ruby DSL that is both concise and infinitely flexible.\n\nFor example, the following one-liner returns the average GDP for the five biggest countries in the middle east region:\n\n  DB[:countries].filter(:region => 'Middle East').reverse_order(:area).limit(5).avg(:GDP)\n\nWhich is equivalent to:\n\n  SELECT avg(GDP) FROM countries WHERE region = 'Middle East' ORDER BY area DESC LIMIT 5\n\nSince datasets retrieve records only when needed, they can be stored and later reused. Records are fetched as hashes (they can also be fetched as custom model objects), and are accessed using an Enumerable interface:\n\n  middle_east = DB[:countries].filter(:region => 'Middle East')\n  middle_east.order(:name).each {|r| puts r[:name]}\n\nSequel also offers convenience methods for extracting data from Datasets, such as an extended map method:\n\n  middle_east.map(:name) #=> ['Egypt', 'Greece', 'Israel', ...]\n\nOr getting results as a transposed hash, with one column as key and another as value:\n\n  middle_east.to_hash(:name, :area) #=> {'Israel' => 20000, 'Greece' => 120000, ...}\n\nMuch of Sequel is still undocumented (especially the part relating to model classes). The following section provides examples of common usage. Feel free to explore...\n\n== Getting Started\n\n=== Connecting to a database\n\nTo connect to a database you simply provide Sequel with a URL:\n\n  require 'sequel'\n  DB = Sequel.open 'sqlite:///blog.db'\n\nThe connection URL can also include such stuff as the user name and password:\n\n  DB = Sequel.open 'postgres://cico:12345@localhost:5432/mydb'\n\nYou can also specify optional parameters, such as the connection pool size, or a logger for logging SQL queries:\n\n  DB = Sequel.open(\"postgres://postgres:postgres@localhost/my_db\",\n    :max_connections => 10, :logger => Logger.new('log/db.log'))\n\n=== Arbitrary SQL queries\n\n  DB.execute(\"create table t (a text, b text)\")\n  DB.execute(\"insert into t values ('a', 'b')\")\n\nOr more succinctly:\n\n  DB << \"create table t (a text, b text)\"\n  DB << \"insert into t values ('a', 'b')\"\n\n=== Getting Dataset Instances\n\nDataset is the primary means through which records are retrieved and manipulated. You can create an blank dataset by using the dataset method:\n\n  dataset = DB.dataset\n\nOr by using the from methods:\n\n  posts = DB.from(:posts)\n\nYou can also use the equivalent shorthand:\n\n  posts = DB[:posts]\n\nNote: the dataset will only fetch records when you explicitly ask for them, as will be shown below. Datasets can be manipulated to filter through records, change record order and even join tables, as will also be shown below.\n\n=== Retrieving Records\n\nYou can retrieve records by using the all method:\n\n  posts.all\n\nThe all method returns an array of hashes, where each hash corresponds to a record.\n\nYou can also iterate through records one at a time:\n\n  posts.each {|row| p row}\n\nOr perform more advanced stuff:\n\n  posts.map(:id)\n  posts.inject({}) {|h, r| h[r[:id]] = r[:name]}\n\nYou can also retrieve the first record in a dataset:\n\n  posts.first\n\nOr retrieve a single record with a specific value:\n\n  posts[:id => 1]\n\nIf the dataset is ordered, you can also ask for the last record:\n\n  posts.order(:stamp).last\n\n=== Filtering Records\n\nThe simplest way to filter records is to provide a hash of values to match:\n\n  my_posts = posts.filter(:category => 'ruby', :author => 'david')\n\nYou can also specify ranges:\n\n  my_posts = posts.filter(:stamp => (2.weeks.ago)..(1.week.ago))\n\nOr lists of values:\n\n  my_posts = posts.filter(:category => ['ruby', 'postgres', 'linux'])\n\nSequel now also accepts expressions as closures, AKA block filters:\n\n  my_posts = posts.filter {:category == ['ruby', 'postgres', 'linux']}\n\nWhich also lets you do stuff like:\n\n  my_posts = posts.filter {:stamp > 1.month.ago}\n\nSome adapters (like postgresql) will also let you specify Regexps:\n\n  my_posts = posts.filter(:category => /ruby/i)\n\nYou can also use an inverse filter:\n\n  my_posts = posts.exclude(:category => /ruby/i)\n\nYou can then retrieve the records by using any of the retrieval methods:\n\n  my_posts.each {|row| p row}\n\nYou can also specify a custom WHERE clause:\n\n  posts.filter('(stamp < ?) AND (author <> ?)', 3.days.ago, author_name)\n\nDatasets can also be used as subqueries:\n\n  DB[:items].filter('price > ?', DB[:items].select('AVG(price) + 100'))\n\n=== Summarizing Records\n\nCounting records is easy:\n  posts.filter(:category => /ruby/i).count\n\nAnd you can also query maximum/minimum values:\n  max_value = DB[:history].max(:value)\n\nOr calculate a sum:\n  total = DB[:items].sum(:price)\n\n=== Ordering Records\n\n  posts.order(:stamp)\n\nYou can also specify descending order\n\n  posts.order(:stamp.DESC)\n\n=== Deleting Records\n\n  posts.filter('stamp < ?', 3.days.ago).delete\n\n=== Inserting Records\n\n  posts.insert(:category => 'ruby', :author => 'david')\n\nOr alternatively:\n\n  posts << {:category => 'ruby', :author => 'david'}\n\n=== Updating Records\n\n  posts.filter('stamp < ?', 3.days.ago).update(:state => 'archived')\n\n=== Joining Tables\n\nJoining is very useful in a variety of scenarios, for example many-to-many relationships. With Sequel it's really easy:\n\n  order_items = DB[:items].join(:order_items, :item_id => :id).\n    filter(:order_items__order_id => 1234)\n\nThis is equivalent to the SQL:\n\n  SELECT * FROM items LEFT OUTER JOIN order_items\n  ON order_items.item_id = items.id \n  WHERE order_items.order_id = 1234\n\nYou can then do anything you like with the dataset:\n\n  order_total = order_items.sum(:price)\n\nWhich is equivalent to the SQL:\n\n  SELECT sum(price) FROM items LEFT OUTER JOIN order_items\n  ON order_items.item_id = items.id\n  WHERE order_items.order_id = 1234\n\n\n",

    "Readme": "= Bus Scheme\n    by Phil Hagelberg (c) 2007 - 2008\n    http://bus-scheme.rubyforge.org\n\n== Description\n\nBus Scheme is a Scheme written in Ruby, but implemented on the bus!\nEvery programmer must implement Scheme as a rite of passage; this is\nmine. Note that at least half of the implementation of Bus Scheme must\nbe written while on a bus. Documentation, tests, and administrivia may\nbe accomplished elsewhere, but the majority of actual implementation\ncode is strictly bus-driven. Bus Scheme is primarily a toy; using it\nfor anything serious is (right now) ill-advised.\n\nBus Scheme aims for general Scheme usefulness optimized for learning\nand fun. It's loosely targeting R5RS, but varies in huge ways. (For\nthe purposes of this project we pretend that R6RS never happened.) See\nthe file R5RS.diff for ways in which Bus Scheme differs from the\nstandard, both things that are yet unimplemented and things that are\nintentionally different.\n\n== Usage\n\n$ bus # drop into the REPL\n\n$ bus -e \"(do some stuff)\"\n\n$ bus foo.scm # load a file\n\n== Tutorial\n\nSee http://technomancy.us/104 for a \"Getting Started\" tutorial.\n\n== Contributing\n\nIf you're looking for stuff to do, try \"rake todo\"\n\nPatches are welcome especially if they were written while riding a\nbus. If your daily commute does not involve a bus but you want to\nsubmit a patch, we may be able to work something out regarding code\nwritten on trains, ferries, or perhaps even carpool lanes.\n\nJoin the mailing list to ask questions and discuss:\nhttp://rubyforge.org/mail/?group_id=5094\n\n== What makes Bus Scheme different?\n\nWell, for starters it's implemented on the bus. No other Scheme\nimplementation can claim this. Here are a few other things that set\nBus Scheme apart:\n\n=== Flexible calling syntax\n\nTaking a hint from Arc, Bus Scheme allows you to use the notation\n(mylist n) to access the nth place of the mylist list instead of (nth\nmylist n) or the (myhash key) notation to access the slot in myhash\ncorresponding to the value of key instead of (gethash myhash key). \nTODO: This notation is flexible, and other data types may have\ntheir own \"call behaviour\" specified.\n\n=== Web functionality\n\nPlanned: Web and RESTful application development are part of the\npackage. Bus Scheme uses the Rack library to allow scheme programs to\nserve web applications. Representations of data can be easily\ntranslated between s-expressions, HTML, and JSON.\n\n=== Written in a high-level language\n\nBus Scheme is written in Ruby, which means anyone with experience in\nhigh-level dynamic languages (like, oh, I don't know... Scheme?)\nshould be right at home poking around at the implementation. Using\nRuby allows the implementation code to remain compact and concise. Bus\nScheme should run on Ruby 1.8, Ruby 1.9, Rubinius, and JRuby at\nleast. Bus Scheme also allows you to drop into Ruby when that's\nconvenient. TODO: allow real inline Ruby blocks instead of access via\na function call.\n\n=== Test-Driven\n\nBus Scheme is written in an entirely test-driven manner. As much as\npossible, it tries to keep its tests written in Scheme itself, so it\nincludes a fairly comprehensive testing suite and encourages programs\nto be written test-first.\n\n== Install\n\n* sudo gem install bus-scheme\n\nFor the source:\n\n* git clone git://github.com/technomancy/bus-scheme.git\n\n== Todo\n\nBus Scheme is currently missing pieces of functionality:\n\n=== Parser\n* multiline strings\n* regular expressions\n\n=== General\n* filter stacktrace\n* continuations\n* macros\n\nFailing tests for some of these are already included (commented out,\nmostly) in the relevant test files.\n\n=== Long Term (post 1.0)\n* web functions (defresource and friends)\n* (lambda (arg1 arg2 . args) body) for rest args\n* string interpolation\n* escape sequences in strings\n* Ruby blocks inline?\n* XML literals?\n* optimize tail call recursion\n* compile to Rubinius bytecode\n* custom call behaviour\n* parse non-decimal base numbers\n* parse rationals, scientific, complex, and polar complex numbers\n\n== Requirements\n\nBus Scheme should run on (at least) Ruby 1.8, Ruby 1.9, Rubinius,\nJRuby. Any support for Windows is entirely accidental.\n\n== Bonus Fact\n\nI haven't actually used a real Scheme yet. Everything I know about it\nI've gathered from reading The Little Schemer, watching the Structure\nand Interpretation of Computer Programs videos, and reading lots about\nCommon Lisp and Emacs Lisp. If there are huge gaping flaws in the\nimplementation, this is likely to be why.\n\n",

install and lock in your new gem.\nNext you'll want to run the special Rails 3 generator:\n$ [bundle exec] rails generate forgery\n\nRails 2.x\nFor Rails 2.x you'll need to do something a little different, by first editing your Rails.root/config/environment.rb and adding this to the configuration block:\nconfig.gem 'forgery'\nThen you'll need to run this in your command line:\n$

    "Readme": "= An Ambitious Sphinx Adapter\n\nI don't know about you, but I like me some sexy full-text searching.\n\n== The basics\n\nWant to find all meals that mention bacon?\n\n  Meal.select {'bacon'}\n\nWhat about bacon bits and sour cream?\n\n  Meal.select {'bacon bits' && 'sour cream'}\n\nMaybe with bacon in the name, or cheese in the recipe?\n\n  Meal.select {|m| m.name =~ 'bacon' || m.recipe =~ 'cheese'}\n\nCheese in the name, but not grilled?\n\n  Meal.select {|m| m.name =~ 'bacon' && m.name !~ 'grilled'}\n\n== Pagination\n\nYou're going to want to use pagination. Ultrasphinx, the underlying library, only supports it, as in, you can't just get all the objects matching your query. You _have_ to use paging.\n\nIt's pretty simple:\n\n  Meal.select {'bacon'}.page(2)\n  Meal.select {'bacon'}.page(3)\n\n== Big honking disclaimer\n\nWe're still learning a lot about how sphinx and ambition work, so things are likely to change a lot, and features are likely to be missing.\n\n== Getting Started\n\n\n=== Installing\n\n  sudo gem install ambitious-sphinx\n\n=== Add it to your app\n\nRequire our files somewhere, like at the end of config/environment.rb, maybe create config/initializers/sphinx.rb\n\n  require 'ultrasphinx'\n  require 'ambition/adapters/ambitious_sphinx'\n\n=== Sphinx and Ultrasphinx\n\nYou will also need to go through the motions of setting up ultrasphinx.\n\nThis includes:\n\n * Configuring/installing sphinx\n * Modifying your model to indicate what's to be indexed\n * Bootstrapping ultrasphinx\n\nAll this is discussed in detail in ultrasphinx's README\n\n== Playing with the code base\n\nIn addition to the other dependencies, you'll need to:\n\n  gem install echoe redgreen mocha test-spec\n\nRun the tests with:\n\n  rake test\n\n\n== More information on Sphinx:\n\n -> http://www.sphinxsearch.com/\n -> http://blog.evanweaver.com/articles/2007/07/09/ultrasphinx-searching-the-world-in-231-seconds/\n -> http://blog.evanweaver.com/files/doc/fauna/ultrasphinx/files/README.html\n\n== More information on Ambition:\n\n-> http://ambition.rubyforge.org\n-> http://groups.google.com/group/ambition-rb/\n\n",

    "Readme": "Soup is a bit of everything, summoned from nothing. Soup is like an imaginary friend - comforting, \nand will often talk to you, but when you look closely, they don't exist.\n\nTerrifying. And so:\n\n  require 'soup'\n  soup = Soup.new(File.join(\"soup\", __FILE__))\n\n  soup << { \n    :name => \"James\",\n    :skills => \"Bowstaff, nunchuck\" \n  }\n\n  # ...much later...\n\n  s = soup['james']\n  s.skills # => \"Bowstaff, nunchuck\"\n\n  soup << {\n    :mane => \"Lush and thick\"\n    :teeth => \"Sharp and ready\"\n    :position => \"Above my bed!!!\" \n  }\n\n\nThe point is that you can set any attribute on a Soup data, and it will be persisted without \ncare. With reckless abandon, really.\n\nThe data can be stored using anything - Soup doesn't really care much about the underlying \npersistence layer. I've written implementations using DataMapper, ActiveRecord and Sequel... \nthere are other implementations of course. Unknowable implementations. \nTerrifying implementations. You Fool!

    "Readme": "Welcome to Rails\nRails is a web-application framework that includes everything needed to\ncreate database-backed web applications according to the\nModel-View-Controller (MVC)\npattern.\nUnderstanding the MVC pattern is key to understanding Rails. MVC divides your\napplication into three layers, each with a specific responsibility.\nThe Model layer represents your domain model (such as Account, Product,\nPerson, Post, etc.) and encapsulates the business logic that is specific to\nyour application. In Rails, database-backed model classes are derived from\nActiveRecord::Base. Active Record allows you to present the data from\ndatabase rows as objects and embellish these data objects with business logic\nmethods. You can read more about Active Record in its README.\nAlthough most Rails models are backed by a database, models can also be ordinary\nRuby classes, or Ruby classes that implement a set of interfaces as provided by\nthe Active Model module. You can read more about Active Model in its README.\nThe Controller layer is responsible for handling incoming HTTP requests and\nproviding a suitable response. Usually this means returning HTML, but Rails controllers\ncan also generate XML, JSON, PDFs, mobile-specific views, and more. Controllers load and\nmanipulate models, and render view templates in order to generate the appropriate HTTP response.\nIn Rails, incoming requests are routed by Action Dispatch to an appropriate controller, and\ncontroller classes are derived from ActionController::Base. Action Dispatch and Action Controller\nare bundled together in Action Pack. You can read more about Action Pack in its\nREADME.\nThe View layer is composed of \"templates\" that are responsible for providing\nappropriate representations of your application's resources. Templates can\ncome in a variety of formats, but most view templates are HTML with embedded\nRuby code (ERB files). Views are typically rendered to generate a controller response,\nor to generate the body of an email. In Rails, View generation is handled by Action View.\nYou can read more about Action View in its README.\nActive Record, Action Pack, and Action View can each be used independently outside Rails.\nIn addition to them, Rails also comes with Action Mailer (README), a library\nto generate and send emails; Active Job (README), a\nframework for declaring jobs and making them run on a variety of queueing\nbackends; and Active Support (README), a collection\nof utility classes and standard library extensions that are useful for Rails,\nand may also be used independently outside Rails.\nGetting Started\n\nInstall Rails at the command prompt if you haven't yet:\ngem install rails\n\nAt the command prompt, create a new Rails application:\nrails new myapp\n\nwhere \"myapp\" is the application name.\nChange directory to myapp and start the web server:\ncd myapp\nrails server\n\nRun with --help or -h for options.\nUsing a browser, go to http://localhost:3000 and you'll see:\n\"Welcome aboard: You're riding Ruby on Rails!\"\nFollow the guidelines to start developing your application.

    "Readme": "Audited   \nAudited (previously acts_as_audited) is an ORM extension that logs all changes to your models. Audited can also record who made those changes, save comments and associate models related to the changes.\nAudited currently (4.x) works with Rails 5.0 and 4.2. It may work with 4.1 and 4.0, but this is not guaranteed.\nFor Rails 3, use gem version 3.0 or see the 3.0-stable branch.\nSupported Rubies\nAudited supports and is tested against the following Ruby versions:\n\n2.1.5\n2.2.4\n2.3.1\n\nAudited may work just fine with a Ruby version not listed above, but we can't guarantee that it will. If you'd like to maintain a Ruby that isn't listed, please let us know with a pull request.\nSupported ORMs\nAudited is currently ActiveRecord-only. In a previous life, Audited worked with MongoMapper. Use the 4.2-stable branch if you need MongoMapper.\nInstallation\nAdd the gem to your Gemfile:\ngem \"audited\", \"~> 4.3\"\nIf you are using rails 5.0, you would also need the following line in your Gemfile.\ngem \"rails-observers\", github: 'rails/rails-observers'\nThen, from your Rails app directory, create the audits table:\n$ rails generate audited:install\n$ rake db:migrate\nUpgrading\nIf you're already using Audited (or acts_as_audited), your audits table may require additional columns. After every upgrade, please run:\n$ rails generate audited:upgrade\n$ rake db:migrate\nUpgrading will only make changes if changes are needed.\nUsage\nSimply call audited on your models:\nclass User < ActiveRecord::Base\n  audited\nend\nBy default, whenever a user is created, updated or destroyed, a new audit is created.\nuser = User.create!(name: \"Steve\")\nuser.audits.count # => 1\nuser.update_attributes!(name: \"Ryan\")\nuser.audits.count # => 2\nuser.destroy\nuser.audits.count # => 3\nAudits contain information regarding what action was taken on the model and what changes were made.\nuser.update_attributes!(name: \"Ryan\")\naudit = user.audits.last\naudit.action # => \"update\"\naudit.audited_changes # => {\"name\"=>[\"Steve\", \"Ryan\"]}\nYou can get previous versions of a record by index or date, or list all\nrevisions.\nuser.revisions\nuser.revision(1)\nuser.revision_at(Date.parse(\"2016-01-01\"))\nSpecifying columns\nBy default, a new audit is created for any attribute changes. You can, however, limit the columns to be considered.\nclass User < ActiveRecord::Base\n  # All fields\n  # audited\n\n  # Single field\n  # audited only: :name\n\n  # Multiple fields\n  # audited only: [:name, :address]\n\n  # All except certain fields\n  # audited except: :password\nend\nSpecifying callbacks\nBy default, a new audit is created for any Create, Update or Destroy action. You can, however, limit the actions audited.\nclass User < ActiveRecord::Base\n  # All fields and actions\n  # audited\n\n  # Single field, only audit Update and Destroy (not Create)\n  # audited only: :name, on: [:update, :destroy]\nend\nComments\nYou can attach comments to each audit using an audit_comment attribute on your model.\nuser.update_attributes!(name: \"Ryan\", audit_comment: \"Changing name, just because\")\nuser.audits.last.comment # => \"Changing name, just because\"\nYou can optionally add the :comment_required option to your audited call to require comments for all audits.\nclass User < ActiveRecord::Base\n  audited :comment_required => true\nend\nCurrent User Tracking\nIf you're using Audited in a Rails application, all audited changes made within a request will automatically be attributed to the current user. By default, Audited uses the current_user method in your controller.\nclass PostsController < ApplicationController\n  def create\n    current_user # => #<User name: \"Steve\">\n    @post = Post.create(params[:post])\n    @post.audits.last.user # => #<User name: \"Steve\">\n  end\nend\nTo use a method other than current_user, put the following in an initializer:\nAudited.current_user_method = :authenticated_user\nOutside of a request, Audited can still record the user with the as_user method:\nAudited::Audit.as_user(User.find(1)) do\n  post.update_attribute!(title: \"Hello, world!\")\nend\npost.audits.last.user # => #<User id: 1>\nCustom Auditor\nYou might need to use a custom auditor from time to time. It can be done by simply passing in a string:\nclass ApplicationController < ActionController::Base\n  def authenticated_user\n    if current_user\n      current_user\n    else\n      'Elon Musk'\n    end\n  end\nend\nAssociated Audits\nSometimes it's useful to associate an audit with a model other than the one being changed. For instance, given the following models:\nclass User < ActiveRecord::Base\n  belongs_to :company\n  audited\nend\n\nclass Company < ActiveRecord::Base\n  has_many :users\nend\nEvery change to a user is audited, but what if you want to grab all of the audits of users belonging to a particular company? You can add the :associated_with option to your audited call:\nclass User < ActiveRecord::Base\n  belongs_to :company\n  audited associated_with: :company\nend\n\nclass Company < ActiveRecord::Base\n  has_many :users\n  has_associated_audits\nend\nNow, when an audit is created for a user, that user's company is also saved alongside the audit. This makes it much easier (and faster) to access audits indirectly related to a company.\ncompany = Company.create!(name: \"Collective Idea\")\nuser = company.users.create!(name: \"Steve\")\nuser.update_attribute!(name: \"Steve Richert\")\nuser.audits.last.associated # => #<Company name: \"Collective Idea\">\ncompany.associated_audits.last.auditable # => #<User name: \"Steve Richert\">\nDisabling auditing\nIf you want to disable auditing temporarily doing certain tasks, there are a few\nmethods available.\nTo disable auditing on a save:\n@user.save_without_auditing\nor:\n@user.without_auditing do\n  @user.save\nend\nTo disable auditing on a column:\nUser.non_audited_columns = [:first_name, :last_name]\nTo disable auditing on an entire model:\nUser.auditing_enabled = false\nGotchas\nUsing attr_protected with Rails 4.x\nIf you're using the protected_attributes gem with Rails 4.0, 4.1 or 4.2 (the gem isn't supported in Rails 5.0 or higher), you'll have to take an extra couple of steps to get audited working.\nFirst be sure to add allow_mass_assignment: true to your audited call; otherwise Audited will\ninterfere with protected_attributes and none of your save calls will work.\nclass User < ActiveRecord::Base\n  audited allow_mass_assignment: true\nend\nSecond, be sure to add audit_ids to the list of protected attributes to prevent data loss.\nclass User < ActiveRecord::Base\n  audited allow_mass_assignment: true\n  attr_protected :logins, :audit_ids\nend\nSupport\nYou can find documentation at: http://rdoc.info/github/collectiveidea/audited\nOr join the mailing list to get help or offer suggestions.\nContributing\nIn the spirit of free software, everyone is encouraged to help improve this project.

To change these, you can provide a mapping in the :address option:\nclass Event < ActiveRecord::Base\n  acts_as_geocodable address: { street: :address1, locality: :city, region: :state, postal_code: :zip }\nend\nIf that doesn't meet your needs, simply override the default to_location method in your model, and return a Graticule::Location with those attributes set.\nacts_as_geocodable can also update your address fields with the data returned from the geocoding service:\nclass Event < ActiveRecord::Base\n  acts_as_geocodable normalize_address: true\nend\nIP-based Geocoding\nacts_as_geocodable adds a remote_location method in your controllers that uses http://hostip.info to guess remote users location based on their IP address.\ndef index\n  @nearest = Store.origin(remote_location).nearest if remote_location\n  @stores = Store.all\nend\nKeep in mind that IP-based geocoding is not always accurate, and often will not return any results.\nContributing\nIn the spirit of free software, everyone is encouraged to help improve this project.\nHere are some ways you can contribute:\n\nusing alpha, beta, and prerelease versions\nreporting bugs\nsuggesting new features\nwriting or editing documentation\nwriting specifications\nwriting code (no patch is too small: fix typos, add comments, clean up inconsistent whitespace)\nrefactoring code\nclosing issues\nreviewing patches\n\nSubmitting an Issue\nWe use the GitHub issue tracker to track bugs\nand features.

    "Readme": "= Halcyon\n== JSON Application Framework\n\nA JSON Web Application Framework for developing lightweight applications\ninterfaced via JSON-encoded HTTP requests. This is ideal for back end\napplications serving functionality for other applications.\n\nHalcyon consists of two parts, the server application and the client. The\nserver application is similar to a Merb or Rails app, without the need for\nimplementing views, and the client is used to facilitate talking to the\napplication from other applications.\n\n\n== On Rack\n\nHalcyon is a Rack application, meaning that it can sit right along with any\nother Rack app, such as a Merb or Rails app, and can be manipulated by any\nkind of Rack middleware/filter. This means that interfacing with Halcyon in\nunconventional ways is trivial since the Rack specification makes communicating\nwith Rack apps dead simple.\n\n\n== Development\n\nHalcyon is actively being developed by a very small community of developers and\ncontributors. Halcyon has seen a good deal of paradigm shift up until the 0.5.0\nrelease, but with that release its internal API has stabilized and should\nremain fairly backwards compatible from here on.\n\nThe changes made on the way to the 0.5.0 codebase were to remove all of the\nserver-like code to make Halcyon more application-centric and also to model\napplication development and structure to be more Rails- or Merb-like, though\nthis was just the natural evolution of Halcyon's design.\n\n\n== Installation\n\nA Gem of Halcyon is available.  You can install it with:\n\n  $ sudo gem install halcyon\n\nThe latest development release can be installed with RubyGems:\n\n  $ sudo gem install halcyon --source http://halcyon.rubyforge.org/latest/\n\nAlternatively, you can install the latest development efforts from the git\nrepository, located at http://github.com/mtodd/halcyon:\n\n  $ git clone git://github.com/mtodd/halcyon.git\n  $ cd halcyon; rake install\n\nDon't forget to install the JSON gem for improved performance:\n\n  $ sudo gem install json\n\nMore in depth documentation can be found at\nhttp://halcyon.rubyforge.org/docs/installation.html.\n\n\n== Usage\n\nAfter installing a Halcyon app, you can generate a new app, similar to the\n<tt>rails</tt> or <tt>merb-gen app</tt> commands, with this:\n\n  $ halcyon init app_name\n\nThis will create a directory and generate a skeletal Halcyon application. You\ncan run this application without changing anything; here's how:\n\n  $ cd app_name\n  $ halcyon start -p 4647\n\nA great tutorial to dive right into using Halcyon and writing apps is located\nat http://halcyon.rubyforge.org/docs/tutorial.html. This will step you through\nwhat to do, what to expect, and what it means.\n\n\n== Contact\n\nPlease mail bugs, suggestions and patches to <mailto:chiology@gmail.com>.\n\nYou are also welcome to join the #halcyon channel on irc.freenode.net.\n\nOur website is up so stop by and check out what's going down.

Then tell facebox where you've put src/loading.gif and src/closelabel.png\n$.facebox.settings.closeImage = '/images/facebox/closelabel.png'\n$.facebox.settings.loadingImage = '/images/facebox/loading.gif'\n\nCalling facebox() on any anchor tag will do the trick, it's easier to give your Faceboxy links a rel=\"facebox\"  and hit them all onDomReady.\njQuery(document).ready(function($) {\n  $('a[rel*=facebox]').facebox()\n})\n\nAny anchor links with rel=\"facebox\" with now automatically use facebox:\n<a href=\"#terms\" rel=\"facebox\">Terms</a>\n  Loads the #terms div in the box\n\n<a href=\"terms.html\" rel=\"facebox\">Terms</a>\n  Loads the terms.html page in the box\n\n<a href=\"terms.png\" rel=\"facebox\">Terms</a>\n  Loads the terms.png image in the box\n\nUsing facebox programmatically\njQuery.facebox('some html')\njQuery.facebox('some html', 'my-groovy-style')\n\nThe above will open a facebox with \"some html\" as the content.\njQuery.facebox(function($) {\n  $.get('blah.html', function(data) { $.facebox(data) })\n})\n\nThe above will show a loading screen before the passed function is called,\nallowing for a better ajaxy experience.\nThe facebox function can also display an ajax page, an image, or the contents of a div:\njQuery.facebox({ ajax: 'remote.html' })\njQuery.facebox({ ajax: 'remote.html' }, 'my-groovy-style')\njQuery.facebox({ image: 'stairs.jpg' })\njQuery.facebox({ image: 'stairs.jpg' }, 'my-groovy-style')\njQuery.facebox({ div: '#box' })\njQuery.facebox({ div: '#box' }, 'my-groovy-style')\n\nEvents\nWant to close the facebox?  Trigger the close.facebox document event:\njQuery(document).trigger('close.facebox')\n\nFacebox also has a bunch of other hooks:\n\nloading.facebox\nbeforeReveal.facebox\nreveal.facebox (aliased as afterReveal.facebox)\ninit.facebox\nafterClose.facebox  (callback after closing facebox)\n\nSimply bind a function to any of these hooks:\n$(document).bind('reveal.facebox', function() { ...stuff to do after the facebox and contents are revealed... })\n\nCustomization\nYou can give the facebox container an extra class (to fine-tune the display of the facebox) with the facebox[.class] rel syntax.\n<a href=\"remote.html\" rel=\"facebox[.bolder]\">text</a>\n\nContact & Help\nIf you have questions, feel free to ask on the Google Groups Mailing List.

    "Readme": "Haml\n\n\n\n\n\nHaml is a templating engine for HTML. It's designed to make it both easier and\nmore pleasant to write HTML documents, by eliminating redundancy, reflecting the\nunderlying structure that the document represents, and providing an elegant syntax\nthat's both powerful and easy to understand.\nBasic Usage\nHaml can be used from the command line or as part of a Ruby web framework. The\nfirst step is to install the gem:\ngem install haml\nAfter you write some Haml, you can run\nhaml document.haml\nto compile it to HTML. For more information on these commands, check out\nhaml --help\nTo use Haml programatically, check out the YARD documentation.\nUsing Haml with Rails\nTo use Haml with Rails, simply add Haml to your Gemfile and run bundle.\ngem 'haml'\nHaml 5 will require Rails version 4.0 or later. If you are using Rails 3.x, you should use Haml version 4.0.x:\ngem 'haml', '~> 4.0.5'\nIf you'd like to replace Rails's Erb-based generators with Haml, add\nhaml-rails to your Gemfile as well.\nFormatting\nThe most basic element of Haml is a shorthand for creating HTML:\n%tagname{:attr1 => 'value1', :attr2 => 'value2'} Contents\nNo end-tag is needed; Haml handles that automatically. If you prefer HTML-style\nattributes, you can also use:\n%tagname(attr1='value1' attr2='value2') Contents\nAdding class and id attributes is even easier. Haml uses the same syntax as\nthe CSS that styles the document:\n%tagname#id.class\nIn fact, when you're using the <div> tag, it becomes even easier. Because\n<div> is such a common element, a tag without a name defaults to a div. So\n#foo Hello!\nbecomes\n<div id='foo'>Hello!</div>\nHaml uses indentation to bring the individual elements to represent the HTML\nstructure. A tag's children are indented beneath than the parent tag. Again, a\nclosing tag is automatically added. For example:\n%ul\n  %li Salt\n  %li Pepper\nbecomes:\n<ul>\n  <li>Salt</li>\n  <li>Pepper</li>\n</ul>\nYou can also put plain text as a child of an element:\n%p\n  Hello,\n  World!\nIt's also possible to embed Ruby code into Haml documents. An equals sign, =,\nwill output the result of the code. A hyphen, -, will run the code but not\noutput the result. You can even use control statements like if and while:\n%p\n  Date/Time:\n  - now = DateTime.now\n  %strong= now\n  - if now > DateTime.parse(\"December 31, 2006\")\n    = \"Happy new \" + \"year!\"\nHaml provides far more tools than those presented here. Check out the reference\ndocumentation\nfor full details.\nIndentation\nHaml's indentation can be made up of one or more tabs or spaces. However,\nindentation must be consistent within a given document. Hard tabs and spaces\ncan't be mixed, and the same number of tabs or spaces must be used throughout.\nContributing\nContributions are welcomed, but before you get started please read the\nguidelines.\nAfter forking and then cloning the repo locally, install Bundler and then use it\nto install the development gem dependencies:\ngem install bundler\nbundle install\nOnce this is complete, you should be able to run the test suite:\nrake\nYou'll get a warning that you need to install haml-spec, so run this:\ngit submodule update --init\nAt this point rake should run without error or warning and you are ready to\nstart working on your patch!\nNote that you can also run just one test out of the test suite if you're working\non a specific area:\nruby -Itest test/helper_test.rb -n test_buffer_access\nHaml currently supports Ruby 2.0.0 and higher, so please make sure your changes run on 2.0+.\nTeam\nCurrent Maintainers\n\nNorman Clarke\nMatt Wildig\nAkira Matsuda\nTee Parham\n\nAlumni\nHaml was created by Hampton Catlin, the author of\nthe original implementation. Hampton is no longer involved in day-to-day coding,\nbut still consults on language issues.\nNatalie Weizenbaum was for many years the primary developer\nand architect of the \"modern\" Ruby implementation of Haml.\nLicense\nSome of Natalie's work on Haml was supported by Unspace Interactive.\nBeyond that, the implementation is licensed under the MIT License.\nCopyright (c) 2006-2013 Hampton Catlin, Natalie Weizenbaum and the Haml team\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of\nthis software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal in\nthe Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to\nuse, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of\nthe Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so,\nsubject to the following conditions:\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all\ncopies or substantial portions of the Software.\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS\nFOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

    "Name": "brain_buster",
    "Readme": "BrainBuster - A Logic Captcha For Rails\nBrainBuster is a logic captcha for Rails.  A logic captcha attempts to detect automated responses (ie spambots) by asking a simple question, such as a word puzzle or math question.  Logic captchas are often easier for humans to answer then image based captchas, but can exclude foreign users or users with cognitive disabilities.  \nSome example question and answers are:\n\"What is fifteen minus five?\" => \"10\"\n\"Which one of these doesn't fit? 'blue, red, yellow, flower'\" => 'flower'\nFor more on logic captchas and alternate approaches, please see http://www.w3.org/TR/turingtest/#logic\nInstall\nFirst, install from GitHub:\nscript/plugin install git://github.com/rsanheim/brain_buster.git\n\nGenerate the migration, modifying the stock questions and answers if you wish, and migrate:\nscript/generate brain_buster_migration \nrake db:migrate\n\nOptionally set the cookie salt in your ApplicationController (or don't touch it to use the default).  \nAdd the appropriate filters where you want to use the captcha, and make sure to render the _captcha partial in any views where you want to challenge the user with a captcha.  \nDetails\nBrainBuster includes a model for storing questions and answers, a small module that is mixed into ActionController::Bases, a small partial to display the question and input form, and a basic stylesheet for styling the partial.  There is also a \"captcha_footer\" partial that is not functionally required at all, its just included to make it easy to give credit and a little link-love if you find this useful.  The style sheet is also not required of course, it just has a little bit of clean css for the captcha form.\nThis captcha is meant to be user-friendly, so for a questions like \"What is two plus two\", all of the following answers will work: \"4\", \"four\", \"Four\", \"   four   \".  By default, a user only needs to answer a captcha once, then they are cookied and don't have to answer another question until they close/reopen their browser.\nExample\nLets pretend that you have a simple app that displays Pages following fairly standard Rails RESTful conventions.  After initial install and database setup (detailed above), you need to add the filters to the any action(s) you want protected.  \nLets say in PagesController you have a edit action that presents a page to a user in a form, and it posts the change to #update.  So we need to create a captcha before we show the user the edit form, and we need to validate that captcha before we allow the update to succeed.\nclass PagesController\n  before_filter :create_brain_buster, :only => [:edit]\n  before_filter :validate_brain_buster, :only => [:update]\n\n  def edit # your normal code is here\n  def update # updating your models, etc\n\nOverride render_or_redirect_for_captcha_failure in your controller, to handle the captcha failure state.  Note that if you don't override this method, BrainBuster will just do render :text with the brain buster error message -- this is probably not what you want.\nclass PagesController\n\n  def render_or_redirect_for_captcha_failure\n    render :action => \"show\"\n  end\n\nRender the partial in appropriate templates - if we are creating the captcha for the edit action, we probably need the form rendered in edit.html.erb.\n- edit.html.erb:\n  ... inside your form somewhere\n  <%= render :partial => '/captcha' %> \n\nCopy the style sheet into your app's public directory (optional)\ncp vendor/plugins/brain_buster/assets/stylesheets/captcha.css public/stylesheets/             \n\n# add the style sheet to any views that use the captcha\n<%= stylesheet_link_tag 'captcha' %>\n\nThats it.  Now if the captcha fails on update, the filter chain will place the failure message into flash[:error] and call render_or_redirect_for_captcha_failure.  \nTroubleshooting\n\nIf you don't override render_or_redirect_for_captcha_failure, you will see a plain error message for a failed captcha.\nIf you delete a question, the random id finder may try to find that deleted question and blow up.  For now, just insert another question with that same id to fix the issue.\nThe built in questions and answers could be scripted fairly easily by a determined spammer, but usually just having some defense makes bots move on to easier targets.\n\nReal world usage\nTender uses BrainBuster.\nLinks\nHomepage is on GitHub.\nCredits\nRob Sanheim started and maintains BrainBuster\nVarious other folks from http://thinkrelevance.com have paired and helped with issues\n",

    "Name": "rails-authorization-plugin",
    "Readme": "\nNOTE: This repository is historical and not actively maintained. Please seek out alternatives or an active fork.\nAuthorization plugin\nThis plugin provides a flexible way to add authorization to Rails.\nThe authorization process decides whether a user is allowed access to some\nfeature.  It is distinct from the authentication process, which tries to\nconfirm a user is authentic, not an imposter. There are many authentication\nsystems available for Rails, e.g., acts_as_authenticated and LoginEngine.\nThis authorization system will play nicely with them as long as some simple\nrequirements are met:\n\nUser objects are available that implement a has_role?(role,\nauthorizable_object = nil) method. This requirement can be easily handled\nby using acts_as_authorized_user in the User-like class.\n\nIf you want to use \u201crole of model\u201d authorization expressions, like \u201cowner\nof resource\u201d or \u201celigible for :award\u201d, then your models with roles must\nimplement an accepts_role?(role, user) method. This requirement can be\nhandled by using acts_as_authorizable in the model class.\n\nThe authorization plugin provides the following:\n\nA simple way of checking authorization at either the class or instance\nmethod level using #permit and #permit?\n\nAuthorization using roles for the entire application, a model class, or an\ninstance of a model (i.e., a particular object).\n\nSome english-like dynamic methods that draw on the defined roles. You will\nbe able to use methods like \u201cuser.is_fan_of angelina\u201d or\n\u201cangelina.has_fans?\u201d, where a 'fan' is only defined in the roles\ntable.\n\nPick-and-choose a mixin for your desired level of database complexity. For\nall the features, you will want to use \u201cobject roles table\u201d (see below)\n\nExample Usage\nclass MeetingController < ApplicationController\n\n  permit \"rubyists and wanna_be_rubyists\", :except => :public_page\n\n  def public_page\n    render :text => \"We're all in Chicago\"\n  end\n\n  def secret_info\n    permit \"interested in Answers and (matz or dhh)\" do\n      render :text => \"The Answer = 42\"\n    end\n  end\n\n  def find_apprentice\n    @founder = User.find_by_name('matz')\n    permit \"'inner circle' of :founder\" do\n      if request.post?\n        apprentice = User.find_by_skillset(params[:uber_hacker])\n        ruby_community = Group.find_by_name('Ruby')\n        ruby_community.accepts_role 'yarv_builder', apprentice\n      end\n    end\n  end\n\n  def rails_conf\n    @meeting = Meeting.find_by_name('RailsConf')\n    permit \"attendees of :meeting or swedish_mensa_supermodels\" do\n      venue = Hotel.find_by_name(\"Wyndham O'Hare\")\n      current_user.is_traveller_to venue\n      if permit? \"traveller to :venue and not speaker\"\n        Partay.all_night_long\n        @misdeeds = current_user.is_participant_in_what\n      end\n    end\n  end\n\nend\nInstallation\nInstallation of the Authorization plugin is quick and easy.\nStep 1\nOpen a terminal and change directory to the root of your Ruby on Rails\napplication referred to here as 'RAILS_ROOT'. You can choose to\ninstall the plugin using the standard Ruby on Rails tools (recommended), as\na Git sub-module, or by grabbing a tarball.\nStep 2a (Standard install, recommended)\nNOTE : This assumes you are using a current (Rails 2.1.x +) version of\nRails which now has built in support for installing a plugin directly from\na git repo.  This also assumes you have Git installed and working properly.\nYou can always use the manual install shown below if this is not true.\nRun the following command in your RAILS_ROOT:\n./script/plugin install git://github.com/DocSavage/rails-authorization-plugin.git\nThis will install the latest version of the plugin from our GitHub master\nrepo into your RAILS_ROOT/vendor/plugins/rails-authorization-plugin\ndirectory.\nStep 2b (Alternative install using Git sub-module, for advanced users of the Git SCM)\nThe source code for this plugin is maintained in a Git SCM repository. The\nGit repository will always have the latest version of the code.\nYou can install the plugin using Git sub-modules (which are akin to using\nSVN externals). Installing this way allows you to update the plugin code\nlater if needed (but note that it will not update any generated code\ncreated earlier by this plugin such as migrations, which you will need to\nupdate manually). Also note that if you are deploying your code using\nCapistrano this method may cause issues if you are not careful (e.g. the\ncode will be deployed but the sub-modules will not be updated or installed\nat all).\nFrom your RAILS_ROOT directory run:\ngit submodule add git://github.com/DocSavage/rails-authorization-plugin.git vendor/plugins/authorization\nYou should be able to update this plugin in the future with the simple\ncommand (again from RAILS_ROOT):\ngit submodule update\nStep 2c (Alternative manual install from tarball)\nIf you like to install the old school manual way, feel free to download a\ncopy of latest master branch plugin code from:\ngithub.com/docsavage/rails-authorization-plugin/tarball/master\nOnce downloaded, rename the top level dir to\n'rails-authorization-plugin' and then you can stuff that directory\nin your RAILS_ROOT/vendor/plugins directory.\nConfiguration\nThese instructions will show you how to do the initial configuration of the\nplugin.\nChoose a Mixin Type\nHardwired Roles\nThis is the simplest way to use the plugin and requires no database. Roles\nare assumed to be coded into the Model classes using the\nhas_role?(role, obj = nil) method. This method is however more\nlimited in the functionality available to you.\nObject Roles (Recommended, DB Required)\nThe Object Roles Table mixin provides full support for authorization\nexpressions within a database by add a polymorphic field to the Role table.\nBecause roles have polymorphic associations to an authorizable object, we\ncan assign a user to a role for any model instance. So you could declare\nuser X to be a moderator for workshop Y, or you could make user A be the\nowner of resource B.\nThe identity module adds a number of dynamic methods that use defined\nroles. The user-like model gets methods like `user.is_moderator_of group\n(sets user to \u201cmoderator\u201d of group`), user.is_moderator? (returns\ntrue/false if user has some role \u201cmoderator\u201d), and group.has_moderators\n(returns an array of users that have role \u201cmoderator\u201d for the group). If\nyou prefer not to have these dynamic methods available, you can simply\ncomment out the inclusion of the identity module within\nobject_roles_table.rb.\nInitial Configuration Instructions\nChoose one of the installation types identified above and make sure your\napplication provides a current_user method or something that returns the\ncurrent user object (resful_authentication provides this out of the box).\nAt the top of your RAILS_ROOT/config/environment.rb file add something like\nthe following (customized for your controllers and actions of course):\n...\n\n# Authorization plugin for role based access control\n# You can override default authorization system constants here.\n\n# Can be 'object roles' or 'hardwired'\nAUTHORIZATION_MIXIN = \"object roles\"\n\n# NOTE : If you use modular controllers like '/admin/products' be sure\n# to redirect to something like '/sessions' controller (with a leading slash)\n# as shown in the example below or you will not get redirected properly\n#\n# This can be set to a hash or to an explicit path like '/login'\n#\nLOGIN_REQUIRED_REDIRECTION = { :controller => '/sessions', :action => 'new' }\nPERMISSION_DENIED_REDIRECTION = { :controller => '/home', :action => 'index' }\n\n# The method your auth scheme uses to store the location to redirect back to\nSTORE_LOCATION_METHOD = :store_location\n\n# standard rails config below here\nRails::Initializer.run do |config|\n\n...\n\nSet the AUTHORIZATION_MIXIN constant to object roles or hardwired.  (See\ninit.rb in this plugin for how the role support is mixed in.)\n\nSet the LOGIN_REQUIRED_REDIRECTION to match the path or a hash with the\n:controller and :action for your applications login page.\n\nSet the PERMISSION_DENIED_REDIRECTION to match the path or a hash with the\n:controller and :action for your applications permission denied page.\n\nSet the STORE_LOCATION_METHOD to the method your application uses for\nstoring the current URL that the user should return to after authentication\n(e.g. store_location).\n\nSee the PLUGIN_DIRlibauthorization.rb file for the default values of\nLOGIN_REQUIRED_REDIRECTION, PERMISSION_DENIED_REDIRECTION and\nSTORE_LOCATION_METHOD.\n\nCreate the database tables\nIf you plan to use the object roles method you will need to setup a few\ndatabase tables. We have provided a database migration file (Rails 2.0+\ncompatible) that will make this process easy for you. If you plan to use\nthe hardwired mixin, no extra database tables are required. and you can\nskip to the next step.\nRun the following command from your RAILS_ROOT (Note : The generator takes\na model name as its argument, which at this time must be 'Role'.):\n./script/generate role_model Role\nThis will create:\nModel:      RAILS_ROOT/app/models/role.rb\nTest:       RAILS_ROOT/test/unit/role_test.rb\nFixtures:   RAILS_ROOT/test/fixtures/roles.yml\nMigration:  RAILS_ROOT/db/migrate/###_add_role.rb\nAnd now you will need to run a database migration from your RAILS_ROOT:\nrake db:migrate\nJumpstarting with a mixin\nNow we need to add the methods needed by each of your models that will\nparticipate in role based authorization. Typically these models fall into\ntwo categories, the User model, and all other models that will have roles\navailable for use.\nFor a typical installation you would add both mixins to your User model.\nclass User < ActiveRecord::Base\n\n  # Authorization plugin\n  acts_as_authorized_user\n  acts_as_authorizable\n\n...\nThen in each additional model that you want to be able to restrict based on\nrole you would add just the acts_as_authorizable mixin like this:\nclass Event < ActiveRecord::Base\n\n  acts_as_authorizable\n\n...\nYou are done with the configuration!\nThe Specifics\npermit and permit?\npermit and permit? take an authorization expression and a hash of options\nthat typically includes any objects that need to be queried:\npermit <authorization expression> [, options hash ]\npermit? <authorization expression> [, options hash ]\nThe difference between permit and permit? is redirection. permit is a\ndeclarative statement and redirects by default. It can also be used as a\nclass or an instance method, gating the access to an entire controller in a\nbefore_filter fashion.\npermit? is only an instance method, can be used within expressions, does\nnot redirect by default.\nThe authorization expression is a boolean expression made up of permitted\nroles, prepositions, and authorizable models. Examples include \u201cadmin\u201d\n(User model assumed), \u201cmoderator of :workshop\u201d (looks at options hash and\nthen @workshop), \u201c'top salesman' at :company\u201d (multiword roles\ndelimited by single quotes), or \u201cscheduled for Exam\u201d (queries class method\nof Exam).\nNote that we can use several permitted prepositions ('of',\n'for', 'in', 'on', 'to', 'at',\n'by'). In the discussion below, we assume you use the \u201cof\u201d\npreposition. You can modify the permitted prepositions by changing the\nconstant in Authorization::Base::Parser.\n\nIf a specified role has no \u201cof <model>\u201d designation, we assume it is\na user role (i.e., the model is the user-like object).\n\nIf an \u201cof model\u201d designation is given but no \u201cmodel\u201d key/value is supplied\nin the hash, we check if an instance variable @model if it's available.\n\nIf the model is capitalized, we assume it's a class and query\nModel#self.accepts_role? (the class method) for the permission.\n(Currently only available in ObjectRolesTable mixin.)\n\nFor each role, a query is sent to the appropriate model object.\nThe grammar for the authorization expression is:\n       <expr> ::= (<expr>) | not <expr> | <term> or <expr> | <term> and <expr> | <term>\n       <term> ::= <role> | <role> <preposition> <model>\n<preposition> ::= of | for | in | on | to | at | by\n      <model> ::= /:*\\w+/\n       <role> ::= /\\w+/ | /'.*'/\nParentheses should be used to clarify permissions. Note that you may prefix\nthe model with an optional \u201c:\u201d \u2013 the first versions of Authorization plugin\nmade this mandatory but it's now optional since the mandatory\npreposition makes models unambiguous.\nOptions\n:allow_guests => false.\nWe can allow permission processing without a current user object. The\ndefault is false.\n:user => YourUserObject.\nThe name of your user object.\n:get_user_method => method_name\nThe method name provided should return a user object. Default is\n#current_user, which is the how acts_as_authenticated works.\n:only => [ :method1, :method2 ]\nArray of methods to apply permit (not valid when used in instance methods)\n:except => [ :method1, :method2 ]\nArray of methods that won't have permission checking (not valid when\nused in instance methods)\n:redirect => boolean\nDefault is true. If false, permit will not redirect to denied page.\n:login_required_redirection => path or hash\n\ndefault is \"{ :controller => 'session', :action => 'new' }\"\nPath or Hash where user will be redirected if not logged in ()\n:login_required_message => 'my message'\nA string to present to your users when login is required. Default is\n'Login is required to access the requested page.'\n:permission_denied_redirection => path or hash\nPath or Hash where user will be redirected if logged in but not authorized\n(default is '')\n:permission_denied_message => 'my message'\nMessage that will be presented to the user when permission is denied. \nDefault is 'Permission denied. You cannot access the requested\npage.'\nSetting and getting the roles\nRoles are set by #has_role and #accepts_role methods that are mixed into\nthe User-like object and the authorizable models. User objects can set\nroles and optionally an object scope for that role:\nuser.has_role 'site_admin'\nuser.has_role 'moderator', group\nuser.has_no_role 'site_admin'\nuser.has_no_role 'moderator', group\nuser.has_role 'member', Group\nNote that the last method sets role \u201cmember\u201d on a class \u201cGroup\u201d. Roles can\nbe set with three scopes: entire application (no class or object\nspecified), a model class, or an instance of a model (i.e., a model\nobject).\nModels set roles for specific users:\na_model.accepts_role 'moderator', user\na_model.accepts_no_role 'moderator', user\nModel.accepts_role 'class moderator', user\nThe method language has been chosen to aid memory of the argument order. A\nuser has a role \u201cfoo\u201d, so the role string immediately follows has_role.\nSimilarly, a model accepts a role \u201cfoo\u201d, so the role string immediately\nfollows accepts_role. Then we append the scope.\nSometimes the user-like object might be an authorizable object as well, for\nexample, when you allow 'friend' roles for users. In this case, the\nuser-like object can be declared to be acts_as_authorizable as\nwell as acts_as_authorized_user.\nRole queries follow the same pattern as the setting of roles:\nuser.has_role? 'moderator'\nuser.has_role? 'moderator', group\nuser.has_role? 'member', Group\n\na_model.accepts_role? 'moderator', user\nModel.accepts_role? 'moderator', user\nWhen a user is queried without specifying either a model class or object,\nit returns true if the user has any matching role. For example,\nuser.has_role? 'moderator' returns true if the user is\n'moderator' of a class, a model object, or just a generic\n'moderator'.  Note that if you say user.has_role\n'moderator', the user does not become 'moderator' for\nall classes and model objects; the user simply has a generic role\n'moderator'.\nDynamic methods through the Identity mixin\nThe Object Roles Table version includes some dynamic methods that use the\nroles table.  For example, if you have roles like \u201celigible\u201d, \u201cmoderator\u201d,\nand \u201cowner\u201d, you'll be able to use the following:\nuser.is_eligible_for_what   --> returns array of authorizable objects for which user has role \"eligible\"\nuser.is_moderator_of? group --> returns true/false\nuser.is_moderator_of group  --> sets user to have role \"moderator\" for object group.\nuser.is_administrator       --> sets user to have role \"administrator\" not really tied to any object.\nModels get has_* methods:\ngroup.has_moderators  --> returns array of users with role \"moderator\" on that group\ngroup.has_moderators? --> returns true/false\nAllowed prepositions are optional in the above dynamic methods. They are\nsimply syntactic sugar.  For example, the following are equivalent:\nuser.is_member_of group\nuser.is_member_for group\nuser.is_member group\nAllowed prepositions are required in the authorization expressions because\nthey are used to distinguish \u201crole\u201d and \u201crole of :model\u201d and \u201crole of\nModel\u201d.\nIf you prefer not to pollute your namespace with these dynamic methods, do\nnot include the Identity module in object_roles_table.rb.\nPattern of use\nWe expect the application to provide the following methods:\n#current_user\nReturns some user object, like an instance of my favorite class,\nUserFromMars.  A user object, from the Authorization\nviewpoint, is simply an object that provides a has_role? method.\nNote that duck typing means we don't care what else the\nUserFromMars might be doing.  We only care that we can get an id\nfrom whatever it is, and we can check if a given role string is associated\nwith it. By using acts_as_authorized_user, we inject what we need\ninto the user object.\nIf you use an authorization expression \u201cadmin of :foo\u201d, we check permission\nby asking foo if it accepts_role?('admin', user).\nSo for each model that is used in an expression, we assume that it provides\nthe accepts_role?(role, user) method.\nNote that user can be nil if :allow_guests =>\ntrue.\n#store_location (optional)\nThis method will be called if authorization fails and the user is about to\nbe redirected to the login action. This allows the application to return to\nthe desired page after login.  If the application doesn't provide this\nmethod, the method will not be called.\nThe name of the method for storing a location can be modified by changing\nthe constant STORE_LOCATION_METHOD in environment.rb. Also, the default\nlogin and permission denied pages are defined by the constants\nLOGIN_REQUIRED_REDIRECTION and PERMISSION_DENIED_REDIRECTION in\nauthorization.rb and can be overriden in your environment.rb.\nConventions\nRoles specified without the \u201cof model\u201d designation:\n\nWe see if there is a current_user method available that will\nreturn a user object. This method can be overridden with the :user\nhash.\n\nOnce a user object is determined, we pass the role to\nuser.has_role? and expect a true return value if the user has the\ngiven role.\n\nRoles specified with \u201cof model\u201d designation:\n\nWe attempt to query an object in the options hash that has a matching key.\nExample: permit \"knight for justice\", :justice =>\n@abstract_idea\n\nIf there is no object with a matching key, we see if there's a matching\ninstance variable. Example: @meeting defined before we use permit\n\"moderator of meeting\"\n\nOnce the model object is determined, we pass the role and user (determined\nin the manner above) to model.accepts_role?\n\nUpgrading\nWhen upgrading this plugin, please refer to the following file:\ngithub.com/DocSavage/rails-authorization-plugin/tree/master/UPGRADE.rdoc\nDevelopers Note : Contributing Patches\nPlease see the file README_developers.txt for the methods we would like you\nto use to submit new code features, bugfixes and patches.\n",

    "Name": "userstamp",
    "Readme": "Userstamp Plugin (v 2.0)\nOverview\nThe Userstamp Plugin extends ActiveRecord::Base to add automatic updating of 'creator',\n'updater', and 'deleter' attributes. It is based loosely on the ActiveRecord::Timestamp module.\nTwo class methods (model_stamper and stampable) are implemented in this plugin.\nThe model_stamper method is used in models that are responsible for creating, updating, or\ndeleting other objects. The stampable method is used in models that are subject to being\ncreated, updated, or deleted by 'stampers'.\nInstallation\nInstallation of the plugin can be done using the built in Rails plugin script. Issue the following\ncommand from the root of your Rails application:\n$ ./script/rails plugin install git://github.com/delynn/userstamp.git\n\nor add it to your Gemfile:\ngem 'userstamp'\n\nand run bundle install to install the new dependency.\nOnce installed you will need to restart your application for the plugin to be loaded into the Rails\nenvironment.\nUsage\nIn this new version of the Userstamp plug-in, the assumption is that you have two different\ncategories of objects; those that manipulate, and those that are manipulated. For those objects\nthat are being manipulated there's the Stampable module and for the manipulators there's the\nStamper module. There's also the actual Userstamp module for your controllers that assists in\nsetting up your environment on a per request basis.\nTo better understand how all this works, I think an example is in order. For this example we will\nassume that a weblog application is comprised of User and Post objects. The first thing we need to\ndo is create the migrations for these objects, and the plug-in gives you a userstamps\nmethod for very easily doing this:\nclass CreateUsers < ActiveRecord::Migration\n  def self.up\n    create_table :users, :force => true do |t|\n      t.timestamps\n      t.userstamps\n      t.name\n    end\n  end\n\n  def self.down\n    drop_table :users\n  end\nend\n\nclass CreatePosts < ActiveRecord::Migration\n  def self.up\n    create_table :posts, :force => true do |t|\n      t.timestamps\n      t.userstamps\n      t.title\n    end\n  end\n\n  def self.down\n    drop_table :posts\n  end\nend\nSecond, since Users are going to manipulate other objects in our project, we'll use the\nmodel_stamper method in our User class:\nclass User < ActiveRecord::Base\n  model_stamper\nend\nFinally, we need to setup a controller to set the current user of the application. It's\nrecommended that you do this in your ApplicationController:\nclass ApplicationController < ActionController::Base\n  include Userstamp\nend\nIf all you are interested in is making sure all tables that have the proper columns are stamped\nby the currently logged in user you can stop right here. More than likely you want all your\nassociations setup on your stamped objects, and that's where the stampable class method\ncomes in. So in our example we'll want to use this method in both our User and Post classes:\nclass User < ActiveRecord::Base\n  model_stamper\n  stampable\nend\n\nclass Post < ActiveRecord::Base\n  stampable\nend\nOkay, so what all have we done? The model_stamper class method injects two methods into the\nUser class. They are #stamper= and #stamper and look like this:\ndef stamper=(object)\n  object_stamper = if object.is_a?(ActiveRecord::Base)\n    object.send(\"#{object.class.primary_key}\".to_sym)\n  else\n    object\n  end\n\n  Thread.current[\"#{self.to_s.downcase}_#{self.object_id}_stamper\"] = object_stamper\nend\n\ndef stamper\n  Thread.current[\"#{self.to_s.downcase}_#{self.object_id}_stamper\"]\nend\nThe big change with this new version is that we are now using Thread.current to save the current\nstamper so as to avoid conflict with concurrent requests.\nThe stampable method allows you to customize what columns will get stamped, and also\ncreates the creator, updater, and deleter associations.\nThe Userstamp module that we included into our ApplicationController uses the setter method to\nset which user is currently making the request. By default the 'set_stampers' method works perfectly\nwith the RestfulAuthentication plug-in:\ndef set_stampers\n  User.stamper = self.current_user\nend\nIf you aren't using ActsAsAuthenticated, then you need to create your own version of the\nset_stampers method in the controller where you've included the Userstamp module.\nNow, let's get back to the Stampable module (since it really is the interesting one). The Stampable\nmodule sets up before_* filters that are responsible for setting those attributes at the appropriate\ntimes. It also creates the belongs_to relationships for you.\nIf you need to customize the columns that are stamped, the stampable method can be\ncompletely customized. Here's an quick example:\nclass Post < ActiveRecord::Base\n  acts_as_stampable :stamper_class_name => :person,\n                    :creator_attribute  => :create_user,\n                    :updater_attribute  => :update_user,\n                    :deleter_attribute  => :delete_user\nend\nIf you are upgrading your application from the old version of Userstamp, there is a compatibility\nmode to have the plug-in use the old \"_by\" columns by default. To enable this mode, add the\nfollowing line to the Rails.root/config/initializers/userstamp.rb file:\nDdb::Userstamp.compatibility_mode = true\nIf you are having a difficult time getting the Userstamp plug-in to work, I recommend you checkout\nthe sample application that I created. You can find this application on GitHub\nUninstall\nUninstalling the plugin can be done using the built in Rails plugin script. Issue the following\ncommand from the root of your application:\nscript/plugin remove userstamp\n\nDocumentation\nRDoc has been run on the plugin directory and is available in the doc directory.\nRunning Unit Tests\nThere are extensive unit tests in the \"test\" directory of the plugin. These test can be run\nindividually by executing the following command from the userstamp directory:\nruby test/compatibility_stamping_test.rb\nruby test/stamping_test.rb\nruby test/userstamp_controller_test.rb\n\nBugs & Feedback\nBug reports and feedback are welcome via GitHub Issues. I also encouraged everyone to clone the git repository and make modifications--I'll be more than happy to merge any changes from other people's branches that would be beneficial to the whole project.\nCredits and Special Thanks\nThe original idea for this plugin came from the Rails Wiki article entitled\n\"Extending ActiveRecord\" on the Rails Wiki (no longer published).\n",

    "Readme": "Packet is a pure ruby library for writing network applications in Ruby.\nIt follows Evented Model of network programming and implements almost all the\nfeatures provided by EventMachine.\n\nIt also provides real easy to user UNIX workers for concurrent programming.\n\nIts best to have some examples going:\n\n== Examples\n=== A Simple Echo Server:\nrequire \"rubygems\"\nrequire \"packet\"\n\nclass Foo\n  def receive_data p_data\n    send_data(p_data)\n  end\n\n  def post_init\n    puts \"Client connected\"\n  end\n\n  def connection_completed\n    puts \"Whoa man\"\n  end\n\n  def unbind\n    puts \"Client Disconnected\"\n  end\nend\n\nPacket::Reactor.run do |t_reactor|\n  t_reactor.start_server(\"localhost\",11006,Foo)\nend\n\nThose new to network programming with events and callbacks, will note that,\neach time a new client connects an instance of class Foo is instantiated.\nWhen client writes some data to the socket, receive_data method is invoked.\n\nAlthough Packet implements an API similar to EventMachine, but it differs\nslightly because of the fact that, for a packet app, there can be more than one\nreactor loop running and hence, we don't use Packet.start_server(...).\n\n=== A Simple Http Client\nclass WikiHandler\n  def receive_data p_data\n    p p_data\n  end\n\n  def post_init\n  end\n\n  def unbind\n  end\n\n  def connection_completed\n    send_data(\"GET / \\r\\n\")\n  end\nend\n\nPacket::Reactor.run do |t_reactor|\n  t_reactor.connect(\"en.wikipedia.org\",80,WikiHandler)\nend\n\n\n=== Using Workers\n  Packet enables you to write simple workers, which will run in \n  different process and gives you nice \n  evented handle for concurrent execution of various tasks. \n\n  When, you are writing a scalable networking application \n  using Event Model of network programming,\n  sometimes when processing of certain events take time, \n  your event loop is stuck there. With green\n  threads, you don't really have a way of paralleling \n  your request processing. Packet library, allows\n  you to write simple workers, for executing long \n  running tasks. You can pass data and callbacks as an\n  argument.\n\n  When you are going to use workers in\n  your application, you need to define\n  constant WORKER_ROOT,\n  which is the directory location, where\n  your workers are located. All the workers defined in that directory\n  will be automatically, picked and forked in a\n  new process when your packet app starts. So, a typical\n  packet_app, that wants to use workers, will look like this:\n\n  packet_app_root\n    |\n    |__  lib\n    |\n    |___ worker\n    |\n    |___ config\n    |\n    |___ log\n\n  You would define WORKER_ROOT = PACKET_APP_ROOT/worker\n\n  All the workers must inherit class Packet::Worker, and hence a \n  general skeleton of worker will look like:\n\n    class FooWorker < Packet::Worker\n      set_worker_name :foo_worker #=> This is necessary.\n      def receive_data p_data\n      end\n\n      def connection_completed\n      end\n\n      def unbind\n      end\n\n      def post_init\n      end\n    end\n\n  All the forked workers are connected to master via\n  UNIX sockets, and hence messages passed to workers from master\n  will be available in receive_data method. Also,\n  when you are passing messages to workers, or worker is passing \n  message to master ( in a nutshell, all the internal\n  communication between workers and master ) directly takes\n  place using ruby objects. All the passed ruby objects are\n  dumped and marshalled across unix sockets in a non blocking \n  manner. BinParser class parses dumped binary objects and\n  makes sure, packets received at other end are complete.\n  Usually, you wouldn't need to worry about this little detail.\n\n  Packet provides various ways of interacting with\n  workers. Usually, when a worker is instantiated, a proxy for\n  that worker will also be instantiated at master\n  process. Packet automatically provides a worker proxy(See meta_pimp.rb)\n  for you, but  if you need to multiplex/demultiplex\n  requests based on certain criteria, you may as well define your \n  own worker proxies. Code, would like something like this:\n\n    class FooWorker < Packet::Worker\n      set_worker_proxy :foo_handler\n    end\n\n  When you define, :foo_handler as a proxy for\n  this worker, packet is gonna search for FooHandler class and \n  instantiate it when the worker gets started. All \n  the worker proxies must inherit from Packet::Pimp. \n  Have a look at, Packet::MetaPimp,\n  which acts as a meta pimp for all the workers,\n  which don't have a explicit worker proxy defined.\n\n=== A complete Case :\n\n    Just for kicks, lets write a sample server,\n    which evals whatever clients send to it. But, assuming this 'eval' of \n    client data can be potentially time/cpu\n    consuming ( not to mention dangerous too ), we are gonna ask our eval_worker, to\n    perform eval and return the result to master process, which in \n    turn returns the result to happy client.\n\n    # APP_ROOT/bin/eval_server.rb\n    EVAL_APP_ROOT = File.expand_path(File.join(File.dirname(__FILE__) + \"/..\"))\n    [\"bin\",\"worker\",\"lib\"].each { |x| $LOAD_PATH.unshift(EVAL_APP_ROOT + \"/#{x}\")}\n    WORKER_ROOT = EVAL_APP_ROOT + \"/worker\"\n\n    require \"packet\"\n    class EvalServer\n      def receive_data p_data\n        ask_worker(:eval_worker,:data => p_data, :type => :request)\n      end\n\n      # will be called, when any worker sends data back to master process\n      # it should be noted that, you may have several instances of eval_server in\n      # your master, for each connected client, but worker_receive will be always\n      # be invoked for the instance, which originally made the request.\n      # If you need fine control, over this behaviour, you can implement a worker proxy \n      # on the lines of meta_pimp class. This API will change in future perhaps, as i\n      # expect, better ideas to come.  \n      def worker_receive p_data\n        send_data \"#{p_data[:data]}\\n\"\n      end\n\n      def show_result p_data\n        send_data(\"#{p_data[:response]}\\n\")\n      end\n\n      def connection_completed\n      end\n\n      def post_init\n      end\n\n      def wow\n        puts \"Wow\"\n      end\n    end\n\n    Packet::Reactor.run do |t_reactor|\n      t_reactor.start_server(\"localhost\", 11006,EvalServer) do |instance|\n        instance.wow\n      end\n    end\n\n   # APP_ROOT/worker/eval_worker.rb\n     class EvalWorker < Packet::Worker\n     set_worker_name :eval_worker\n     def worker_init\n       p \"Starting no proxy worker\"\n     end\n\n     def receive_data data_obj\n       eval_data = eval(data_obj[:data])\n       data_obj[:data] = eval_data\n       data_obj[:type] = :response\n       send_data(data_obj)\n     end\n   end\n\n=== Disable auto loading of certain workers:\n  Sometimes, you would need to start a\n  worker at runtime and don't want this pre-forking mechanism.\n  Packet, allows this. You just need to define\n  \"set_no_auto_load true\" in your worker class and worker\n  will not be automatically forked. Although name is a bit misleading perhaps.\n\n  Now, at runtime, you can call start_worker(:foo_worker, options)\n  to start a worker as usual. It should\n  be noted that, forking a worker, which is already\n  forked can be disastrous, since worker names are being\n  used as unique keys that represent a worker.Test\n\n== Performance:\n  Although written in pure ruby, packet performs\n  reasonably well. Mongrel, running on top of Packet is a tad\n  slower than Mongrel running on top of EventMachine. More benchmarks coming soon.\n\n== SVN repo:\n   Code for packet is on google code, svn repo is:\n   http://packet.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/\n\n== Credits\n  Francis for awesome EventMachine lib, which has constantly acted as an inspiration.\n  Ezra, for being a early user and porting mongrel to run on top of packet      \n\n\n\n\n",

    "Readme": "Alfred is a Rails app for controlling other Rails apps. I developed it for myself to keep track of lots of \nlittle prototypes that need to be up and available at various times so that others in the company can view\nand comment on them.\n\nRequirements\n------------\nRails\nMongrel - There is currently the option to start your app with either Mongrel or WEBrick but the code will\n          always try to start with Mongrel only.\n\nKnown Limitations\n-----------------\n* Although the New Project screen says that you can specify WEBrick as the web server, you can't (there's no\n  code in the controller to try anything other than Mongrel).\n* The system does not gracefully respond to errors in your app. Let's say you try to start your app, but you\n  specified the wrong Rails Root. Ideally that project square turns red and gives you some info about why\n  the error occurred. This doesn't happen yet.\n* If you have an app running and you `kill` it, or the server restarts, Mongrel will not restart the app\n  until you clear out the mongrel.pid file (which for some reason seems to sometimes live in /log and\n  other times in /tmp). I attempted some code to rescue from this, but it doesn't seem to work. Haven't\n  had a chance to go back and take a second look.\n* You'll see a link to view the log of the current environment, but this doesn't work yet\n* There's a checkbox in the New Project screen to create the rails app itself along with the project.\n  This doesn't work yet!\n* No tests (sorry).\n\nInstallation\n------------\nPretty simple. Get a copy of the code:\n\n  git clone git://github.com:cannikin/alfred.git   (if you have git)\n    or\n  http://github.com/cannikin/alfred/tarball/master    (if you don't)\n\n`cd` to that directory and initialize the database:\n\n  rake db:create\n  rake db:migrate\n\nNow start the app from Alfred's directory (switching it to a different port if you wish, my default \nis 3100 to keep all the 3000's open for apps):\n\n  mongrel_rails start -p 3100 -d\n\nAlfred is now running and ready to serve your apps:\n\n  http://localhost:3100 \n  (if you used my default port above and you're running it locally).\n\nUsage\n-----\nThe first screen you'll see is the Dashboard. This is where you'll see your projects and their current \nstatus. There's an Extended and Compact view. They both have the same info, just that Compact takes up \nless space. \n\nClick the Settings tab to set the default values for new projects (local hostname, remote \nhostname) as well as the port Alfred is running on and how often he should check for the current status \nof projects. Unless you're doing some volatile testing, or someone else also has access to your apps, \ntheir status isn't going to change very often. 600 seconds is 10 minutes which is still probably more\noften than necessary. \n\nIf you're running this in Firefox 2 you may want to disable Firebug -- after Alfred is open for a \ncouple of days Firefox's RAM tends to get a little out of control, I assume because Firebug is tracking \neach status update AJAX request.\n\nComing Soon\n-----------\n* Properly handle and recover from errors\n* Create a little command line \"engine\" to run all the logic of starting/stopping the apps, handling\n  errors that come back from the command line, etc. (right now this is handled by UtilityController)\n* Ability to view live log\n* Make Environment a dropdown in the dashboard so you can switch to others before starting the app (right\n  now you need to edit the project and change the environment there)\n* Add a Public view so that others can find your apps, but not have access to start/stop them\n* Ideally I would love to integrate with god: http://github.com/mojombo/god\n",

    "Readme": "= RubyPorts -- a hookin-based ports system for Ruby\n\nCopyright (C) 2008 Christian Neukirchen <purl.org/net/chneukirchen>\n\nRubyPorts is freely distributable under the terms of an MIT-style license.\nSee COPYING or http://www.opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.php.\n\n== How to install\n\nRun <tt>hook-bin.rb</tt> and add the <tt>bin</tt> directory to your path.\n\nYou need curl(1) to fetch packages over HTTP.\nYou need tar(1) to unpack packages.\nYou need svn, darcs, and git to check out package repositories.\n\nYou need a development tool chain installed if you want to build\nextensions.  RubyPorts does not provide binaries.\n\n== How to use\n\nUsually, you will want to use RubyPorts directly from the Git checkout.\nPeriodically call <tt>git pull</tt> to keep your ports tree fresh.\n\nUse <tt>ls -1 ports/*/*.rport</tt> to get a list of available ports.\n\nTo install a port, simply type <tt>hook-get.rb /path/to/portsfile.rport</tt>\nto automatically download, build and hookin the port.  Dependencies\nwill be installed automatically if possible.  You can also try to type\n<tt>hook-get.rb portname</tt> and hook-get will try to figure out what\nyou want to install.  Note that this can install unstable and even\nbroken development versions of your code; you may wish to provide a\nversion number as well.\n\nPeriodically call <tt>hook-bin.rb</tt> to update the symlinks in\n<tt>bin</tt>.\n\nSet the environment variable $RUBYPORTS to the full path of the\n\"ports\" directory if you want to call hook-get from any location.\n\n== How RubyPorts works\n\nEvery port consists of a .rport-file that contains download and\nbuilding instructions.  It looks like this:\n\n    # A package-line declaring the package name and version (no\n    # version if it packages the trunk).\n    # This defines the pkgpath as \"mongrel-1.1.3\".\n    package 'mongrel', '1.1.3'\n\n    # A list of dependencies, as by the versioning convention.\n    depend 'fastthread-1.0.1...'\n    depend 'daemons-1.0.3...'\n\n    # A source, which can be:\n    # tar_gz URL:: a tar.gz unpacking(!) into pkgpath\n    # tar_bz2 URL:: a tar.bz2 unpacking(!) into pkgpath\n    # gem URL:: a URL to a .gem file unpacked to pkgpath.\n    # git URL, head=\"HEAD\":: a git checkout of the respective head to pkgpath\n    # svn URL:: a SVN checkout of the URL to pkgpath\n    # darcs URL, tag=nil:: a Darcs checkout of the repo (possibly of a\n    #                      tag) to pkgpath\n    tar_gz \"http://rubyforge.org/frs/download.php/30048/mongrel-1.1.3.tgz\"\n\n    # Optional build commands, run in pkgpath\n    build \"ruby setup.rb config\"\n    build \"ruby setup.rb setup\"\n\n    # A optional \"hookin add\" call, defaulting to \"hookin add $pkgpath\n    # $pkgpath/lib\" if not mentioned.\n    hookin pkgpath, [pkgpath+\"/lib\", pkgpath+\"/ext/http11\"]\n\n== RubyPorts port naming conventions\n\n* foo.rport will install the current development branch from the repository.\n* foo-VERSION.rport will install a release VERSION.\n\n== RubyPorts versioning conventions\n\n* foo means any version of foo.\n* foo-1.0 means any version of foo prefixed with \"1.0\".\n* foo-1.0... means any version of foo starting from \"1.0\".\n* foo-1.0.1...foo-2 means any version of foo starting from \"1.0.1\"\n  up to, but not including any version starting with 2.\n\n== Caveat user\n\nPlease take note of these things:\n\n* RubyPorts is utterly alpha.  There is zero error handling as of now.\n  If it breaks you get to keep both pieces.\n\n* Therefore, consider using a hookin.db on its own for RubyPorts.\n\n== Contact\n\nPlease mail bugs, suggestions and patches to\n<mailto:chneukirchen@gmail.com>.\n\nGit repository (\"git send-email\" is welcome for patches):\ngit clone http://git.vuxu.org/rubyports.git\ngit clone git://github.com/chneukirchen/rubyports.git\n\nPatches contributing a port are welcome *iff*\n* the patch only touch/add the desc and PORT.rport files.\n* the patch is titled \"Added port PORT-VERSION\" or \"Update port\n  PORT-VERSION\".\n* all dependencies are already in RubyPorts or contributed as well.\n\n== Thanks to\n\n* Michael Fellinger, for help with development.\n* pkgsrc/DarwinPorts/OpenBSD ports/portage for inspiration.\n* Paul Feyerabend, for making me open my eyes.\n\n== Copyright\n\nCopyright (C) 2008  Christian Neukirchen <http://purl.org/net/chneukirchen>\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to\ndeal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the\nrights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or\nsell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in\nall copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

In order for Erlang processes in\ndifferent interpreters to communicate with each other, they each need to be\nable to find a file called .erlang.cookie in the home directory of the user\nunder which they are running. The cookie should contain 20 uppercase alpha\ncharacters on a single line (no newline).\n\nGenerate a starter Yaws config file with:\n\n  fuzed-conf RAILS_ROOT 8080 > fuzed.conf\n\nwhere RAILS_ROOT is the absolute path to the root directory of your Rails\nproject. You may optionally specify a port as the second argument. This will\ngenerate a file called 'fuzed.conf' which contains a sample Yaws config file\nthat should be suitable for initial testing.\n\n\n== Starting fuzed\n\nStart the fuzed master server (yaws) locally:\n\n  fuzed start -n server@127.0.0.1 -c fuzed.conf\n\nIn another terminal, start a fuzed client locally:\n\n  fuzed join -n client@127.0.0.1 -m server@127.0.0.1 -r RAILS_ROOT\n\nwhere RAILS_ROOT is the same as before.\n\nPoint your browser at:\n\n  http://localhost:8080\n\nIf everything worked out, you'll see your Rails app!\n\n\n== What is a Valid Hostname?\n  Erlang has a funny notion about what a valid hostname is. Localhost won't\n  cut it. I recommend using rendezvous to point to your local host. Short of\n  that, 127.0.0.1 works.\n\n\n== Contribution Notes\n* Please note that empty directories should contain a .placeholder file\n  (which should be empty), to facilitate the use of other version\n  control systems which bridge to subversion but don't support empty\n  directories.\n",

    "Name": "tumblr",
    "Readme": "== Tumblr\n\nTumblr is a simple Ruby script that aggregates RSS feeds into a \"tumblelog\"-style\nformat, in static files.\n\n=== Feeds\n\nFeeds are specified in <tt>config/feeds.yml</tt> like so:\n\n  blog:\n    url: http://feeds.feedburner.com/kevinmarsh\n    title: Blog\n    generate_permalink: true\n\n  delicious:\n    url: http://del.icio.us/rss/kevinmarsh\n    title: del.icio.us\n\nBecause it is a YAML file, spaces are important (not tabs!). The url and title\nkeys are pretty straightforward, but the <tt>generate_permalink</tt> may be a little\nconfusing. <tt>generate_permalink</tt> should be set to true if you want tumblr to\ncreate its own permalink page for the content and link to that. This is\nespecially useful if you have a RSS-only feed that you'd like to generate a\nstatic page for. The default is to not specify it, therefore preserving the\nfeed's permalink for the post.\n\n=== Templates\n\nTemplates specify how you want tumblr to render the content of your feeds.\nThey are specified on a per-feed basis, so you can have different templates\nfor each type of content (only showing a <tt>media_thumbnail_link</tt> in Flickr, or tags for\ndel.icio.us, for example.)\n\nTemplates are straight-up ERB, so they will look very familiar if you've used\nRails, and there a few key ones everyone should have:\n\n  index.html.erb\n  layout.html.erb\n  post/_[feed_type].html.erb\n  post.[feed_type].html.erb\n\n==== index.html.erb\n\nThis is the template for the main index page and archive pages. It is a listing\nof posts, and may look something like:\n\n  <% last_time = nil %>\n  <% @posts.each do |post| %>\n    <h2><% time = post.time.strftime(\"%A, %B %d, %Y\") %></h2>\n    <%= render post %>\n  <% end %>\n\n==== layout.html.erb\n\nThis is the template for the layout of your site. All the other templates will\nbe wrapped around this one, inserted wherever <%= @content %> is. You'll include\nyour stylesheets, meta tags, doctype, and whatnot here.\n\nYou also have access to a few variables that can give you some flexibility in\nlaying out your tumblr: <tt>@feeds</tt> and <tt>@archives</tt>. They are used thusly:\n\n  <h2>Feeds</h2>\n  <ul id=\"feeds\">\n    <%- @feeds.each do |key, feed| -%>\n    <li class=\"feed <%= key %>\"><a href=\"<%= feed['url'] %>\"><%= feed['title'] %></a></li>\n    <%- end -%>\n  </ul>\n\n  <h2>Archives</h2>\n  <ul>\n    <%- @archives.each do |date, posts| -%>\n    <li><a href=\"/<%= date.year %>/<%= date.month %>/\"><%= date.strftime(\"%B %Y\") %></a> (<%= posts %>)</li>\n    <%- end -%>\n  </ul>\n  </div>    \n\n==== post/_[feed_type].html.erb\n\nThis is the template rendered for each post. You will have one of these for each\nfeed you are displaying in your tumblr so you can customize and tailor the output for each.\n\nFor example, a Flickr feed may show a thumbnail:\n\n  <div class=\"post flickr\">\n    <h1><a href=\"<%= @post.link %>\"><%= @post.title %></a></h1>\n    <img src=\"<%= @post.media_thumbnail_link %>\" alt=\"<%= @post.title %>\" />\n  </div>\n\nWhile a del.icio.us feed will show tags:\n\n  <div class=\"post delicious\">\n    <p><a href=\"<%= @post.link %>\"><%= @post.title %></a></p>\n    <p><%= @post.content %></p>\n    <p class=\"tags\">\n      <%- @post.tags.each do |tag| -%>\n      <a href=\"http://del.icio.us/kevinmarsh/<%= tag %>\"><%= tag %></a>\n      <%- end -%>\n    </p>\n  </div>\n\nNote: templates are ERB, which means you can run any string through Ruby and\nmanipulate the output. This is especially useful for feeds like Twitter, to\nstrip out your username from each post:\n\n  <div class=\"post twitter\">\n    <p><%= @post.content.gsub(/^willcodeforfoo\\:/, \"\") %></p>\n  </div>\n\nThis also means you must be careful!\n\n====  post.[feed_type].html.erb\n\nThis template is very similar to those \"partials\" in the post/ directory,\nbut they are rendered if and when tumblr creates permalink pages for you.\n\n=== Generating\n\nIt is important to note that tumblr generates static files for you, which means\ntumblr is not serving pages for you. You read that right, pages are not dynamic,\nand this is still Web 2.0. You'll have to point your web server to tumblr's\npublic directory.\n\nEach time you invoke <tt>tumblr</tt>, tumblr will fetch new feed items and regenerate\nall your pages (index, monthly archives, and invidual permalink pages if you \nhave feeds with <tt>generate_permalink</tt>). This may seem like overkill, but for\nhigh traffic sites, generating static files once every hour vs. every hit is the\nless expensive route.\n\nTo just re-generate without fetching your feeds, throw tumblr the <tt>--generate</tt>\nflag. You may find yourself wanting this after you tweak a template.\n",

Full list of symbologies and filenames below.\nExample\nrequire 'barby'\nrequire 'barby/barcode/code_128'\nrequire 'barby/outputter/ascii_outputter'\n\nbarcode = Barby::Code128B.new('BARBY')\n\nputs barcode.to_ascii #Implicitly uses the AsciiOutputter\n\n## #    #  #   # ##   # #   ##   ##   # ### #   # ##   ### ## #   ## ### ### ##   ### # ##\n## #    #  #   # ##   # #   ##   ##   # ### #   # ##   ### ## #   ## ### ### ##   ### # ##\n## #    #  #   # ##   # #   ##   ##   # ### #   # ##   ### ## #   ## ### ### ##   ### # ##\n## #    #  #   # ##   # #   ##   ##   # ### #   # ##   ### ## #   ## ### ### ##   ### # ##\n## #    #  #   # ##   # #   ##   ##   # ### #   # ##   ### ## #   ## ### ### ##   ### # ##\n## #    #  #   # ##   # #   ##   ##   # ### #   # ##   ### ## #   ## ### ### ##   ### # ##\n## #    #  #   # ##   # #   ##   ##   # ### #   # ##   ### ## #   ## ### ### ##   ### # ##\n## #    #  #   # ##   # #   ##   ##   # ### #   # ##   ### ## #   ## ### ### ##   ### # ##\n## #    #  #   # ##   # #   ##   ##   # ### #   # ##   ### ## #   ## ### ### ##   ### # ##\n## #    #  #   # ##   # #   ##   ##   # ### #   # ##   ### ## #   ## ### ### ##   ### # ##\n          B          A          R          B          Y\nSupported symbologies\nrequire 'barby/barcode/<filename>'\n\n\nName\nFilename\nDependencies\n\n\n\nCode 25\ncode_25\n\u2500\n\n\n\u251c\u2500 Interleaved\ncode_25_interleaved\n\u2500\n\n\n\u2514\u2500 IATA\ncode_25_iata\n\u2500\n\n\nCode 39\ncode_39\n\u2500\n\n\n\u2514\u2500 Extended\ncode_39\n\u2500\n\n\nCode 93\ncode_93\n\u2500\n\n\nCode 128 (A, B, and C)\ncode_128\n\u2500\n\n\n\u2514\u2500 GS1 128\ngs1_128\n\u2500\n\n\nEAN-13\nean_13\n\u2500\n\n\n\u251c\u2500 Bookland\nbookland\n\u2500\n\n\n\u2514\u2500 UPC-A\nean_13\n\u2500\n\n\nEAN-8\nean_8\n\u2500\n\n\nUPC/EAN supplemental, 2 & 5 digits\nupc_supplemental\n\u2500\n\n\nQR Code\nqr_code\nrqrcode\n\n\nDataMatrix (Semacode)\ndata_matrix\nsemacode\n\n\nPDF417\npdf_417\nJRuby\n\n\nOutputters\nrequire 'barby/outputter/<filename>_outputter'\n\n\nfilename\ndependencies\n\n\n\nascii\n\u2500\n\n\ncairo\ncairo\n\n\nhtml\n\u2500\n\n\npdfwriter\n\u2500\n\n\npng\nchunky_png\n\n\nprawn\nprawn\n\n\nrmagick\nrmagick\n\n\nsvg\n\u2500\n\n\nFormats supported by outputters\n\nText (mostly for testing)\nPNG, JPEG, GIF\nPS, EPS\nSVG\nPDF\nHTML\n\n\nFor more information, check out the Barby wiki.\n",

    "Name": "delayed_job",
    "Readme": "Delayed::Job\nDelayed_job (or DJ) encapsulates the common pattern of asynchronously executing longer tasks in the background.\nIt is a direct extraction from Shopify where the job table is responsible for a multitude of core tasks. Amongst those tasks are:\n\nsending massive newsletters\nimage resizing\nhttp downloads\nupdating smart collections\nupdating solr, our search server, after product changes\nbatch imports\nspam checks\n\nSetup\nThe library evolves around a delayed_jobs table which can be created by using:\n\n  script/generate delayed_job\n\nThe created table looks as follows:\n\n  create_table :delayed_jobs, :force => true do |table|\n    table.integer  :priority, :default => 0      # Allows some jobs to jump to the front of the queue\n    table.integer  :attempts, :default => 0      # Provides for retries, but still fail eventually.\n    table.text     :handler                      # YAML-encoded string of the object that will do work\n    table.string   :last_error                   # reason for last failure (See Note below)\n    table.datetime :run_at                       # When to run. Could be Time.now for immediately, or sometime in the future.\n    table.datetime :locked_at                    # Set when a client is working on this object\n    table.datetime :failed_at                    # Set when all retries have failed (actually, by default, the record is deleted instead)\n    table.string   :locked_by                    # Who is working on this object (if locked)\n    table.timestamps\n  end\n\nOn failure, the job is scheduled again in 5 seconds + N ** 4, where N is the number of retries.\nThe default MAX_ATTEMPTS is 25. After this, the job either deleted (default), or left in the database with \u201cfailed_at\u201d set.\nWith the default of 25 attempts, the last retry will be 20 days later, with the last interval being almost 100 hours.\nThe default MAX_RUN_TIME is 4.hours. If your job takes longer than that, another computer could pick it up. It\u2019s up to you to\nmake sure your job doesn\u2019t exceed this time. You should set this to the longest time you think the job could take.\nBy default, it will delete failed jobs (and it always deletes successful jobs). If you want to keep failed jobs, set\nDelayed::Job.destroy_failed_jobs = false. The failed jobs will be marked with non-null failed_at.\nHere is an example of changing job parameters in Rails:\n\n  # config/initializers/delayed_job_config.rb\n  Delayed::Job.destroy_failed_jobs = false\n  silence_warnings do\n    Delayed::Job.const_set(\"MAX_ATTEMPTS\", 3)\n    Delayed::Job.const_set(\"MAX_RUN_TIME\", 5.minutes)\n  end\n\nNote: If your error messages are long, consider changing last_error field to a :text instead of a :string (255 character limit).\nUsage\nJobs are simple ruby objects with a method called perform. Any object which responds to perform can be stuffed into the jobs table.\nJob objects are serialized to yaml so that they can later be resurrected by the job runner.\n\n  class NewsletterJob < Struct.new(:text, :emails)\n    def perform\n      emails.each { |e| NewsletterMailer.deliver_text_to_email(text, e) }\n    end    \n  end\n\n  Delayed::Job.enqueue NewsletterJob.new('lorem ipsum...', Customers.find(:all).collect(&:email))\n\nThere is also a second way to get jobs in the queue: send_later.\n\n  BatchImporter.new(Shop.find(1)).send_later(:import_massive_csv, massive_csv)\n\nThis will simply create a Delayed::PerformableMethod job in the jobs table which serializes all the parameters you pass to it. There are some special smarts for active record objects\nwhich are stored as their text representation and loaded from the database fresh when the job is actually run later.\nRunning the jobs\nYou can invoke rake jobs:work which will start working off jobs. You can cancel the rake task with CTRL-C.\nYou can also run by writing a simple script/job_runner, and invoking it externally:\n\n  #!/usr/bin/env ruby\n  require File.dirname(__FILE__) + '/../config/environment'\n\n  Delayed::Worker.new.start  \n\nWorkers can be running on any computer, as long as they have access to the database and their clock is in sync. You can even\nrun multiple workers on per computer, but you must give each one a unique name:\n\n  3.times do |n|\n    worker = Delayed::Worker.new\n    worker.name = 'worker-' + n.to_s\n    worker.start\n  end   \n\nKeep in mind that each worker will check the database at least every 5 seconds.\nNote: The rake task will exit if the database has any network connectivity problems.\nCleaning up\nYou can invoke rake jobs:clear to delete all jobs in the queue.\nChanges\n\n1.7.0: Added failed_at column which can optionally be set after a certain amount of failed job attempts. By default failed job attempts are destroyed after about a month.\n\n\n1.6.0: Renamed locked_until to locked_at. We now store when we start a given job instead of how long it will be locked by the worker. This allows us to get a reading on how long a job took to execute.\n\n\n1.5.0: Job runners can now be run in parallel. Two new database columns are needed: locked_until and locked_by. This allows us to use   pessimistic locking instead of relying on row level locks. This enables us to run as many worker processes as we need to speed up queue processing.\n\n\n1.2.0: Added #send_later to Object for simpler job creation\n\n\n1.0.0: Initial release\n",

See below for the wide variety of formats Chronic will parse.\n\n== INSTALLATION:\n\nChronic can be installed via RubyGems:\n\n  $ sudo gem install chronic\n\n== CODE:\n\nBrowse the code and get an RSS feed of the commit log at:\n\n  http://github.com/mojombo/chronic.git\n\nYou can grab the code (and help with development) via git:\n\n  $ git clone git://github.com/mojombo/chronic.git\n\n== USAGE:\n\nYou can parse strings containing a natural language date using the Chronic.parse method.\n\n  require 'rubygems'\n  require 'chronic'\n\n  Time.now   #=> Sun Aug 27 23:18:25 PDT 2006\n\n  #---\n\n  Chronic.parse('tomorrow')       \n    #=> Mon Aug 28 12:00:00 PDT 2006\n\n  Chronic.parse('monday', :context => :past)\n    #=> Mon Aug 21 12:00:00 PDT 2006\n\n  Chronic.parse('this tuesday 5:00')\n    #=> Tue Aug 29 17:00:00 PDT 2006\n\n  Chronic.parse('this tuesday 5:00', :ambiguous_time_range => :none)\n    #=> Tue Aug 29 05:00:00 PDT 2006\n\n  Chronic.parse('may 27th', :now => Time.local(2000, 1, 1))\n    #=> Sat May 27 12:00:00 PDT 2000\n\n  Chronic.parse('may 27th', :guess => false)\n    #=> Sun May 27 00:00:00 PDT 2007..Mon May 28 00:00:00 PDT 2007\n\nSee Chronic.parse for detailed usage instructions.\n\n== EXAMPLES:\n\nChronic can parse a huge variety of date and time formats. Following is a small sample of strings that will be properly parsed. Parsing is case insensitive and will handle common abbreviations and misspellings.\n\nSimple\n\n  thursday\n  november\n  summer\n  friday 13:00\n  mon 2:35\n  4pm\n  6 in the morning\n  friday 1pm\n  sat 7 in the evening\n  yesterday\n  today\n  tomorrow\n  this tuesday\n  next month\n  last winter\n  this morning\n  last night\n  this second\n  yesterday at 4:00\n  last friday at 20:00\n  last week tuesday\n  tomorrow at 6:45pm\n  afternoon yesterday\n  thursday last week\n\nComplex\n\n  3 years ago\n  5 months before now\n  7 hours ago\n  7 days from now\n  1 week hence\n  in 3 hours\n  1 year ago tomorrow\n  3 months ago saturday at 5:00 pm\n  7 hours before tomorrow at noon\n  3rd wednesday in november\n  3rd month next year\n  3rd thursday this september\n  4th day last week\n\nSpecific Dates\n\n  January 5\n  dec 25\n  may 27th\n  October 2006\n  oct 06\n  jan 3 2010\n  february 14, 2004\n  3 jan 2000\n  17 april 85\n  5/27/1979\n  27/5/1979\n  05/06\n  1979-05-27\n  Friday\n  5\n  4:00\n  17:00\n  0800\n\nSpecific Times (many of the above with an added time)\n\n  January 5 at 7pm\n  1979-05-27 05:00:00\n  etc\n\n== LIMITATIONS:\n\nChronic uses Ruby's built in Time class for all time storage and computation. Because of this, only times that the Time class can handle will be properly parsed. Parsing for times outside of this range will simply return nil. Support for a wider range of times is planned for a future release.\n\nTime zones other than the local one are not currently supported. Support for other time zones is planned for a future release.\n\n== LICENSE:\n\n(The MIT License)\n\nCopyright (c) 2008 Tom Preston-Werner\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining\na copy of this software and associated documentation files (the\n\"Software\"), to deal in the Software without restriction, including\nwithout limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish,\ndistribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to\npermit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to\nthe following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be\nincluded in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,\nEXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF\nMERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.\nIN NO EVENT SHALL THE AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY\nCLAIM, DAMAGES OR OTHER LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT,\nTORT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM, OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE\nSOFTWARE OR THE USE OR OTHER DEALINGS IN THE SOFTWARE.\n\n",

    "Readme": "attachment-fu\n=============\n\nattachment_fu is a plugin by Rick Olson (aka technoweenie <http://techno-weenie.net>) and is the successor to acts_as_attachment.  To get a basic run-through of its capabilities, check out Mike Clark's tutorial <http://clarkware.com/cgi/blosxom/2007/02/24#FileUploadFu>.\n\n\nattachment_fu functionality\n===========================\n\nattachment_fu facilitates file uploads in Ruby on Rails.  There are a few storage options for the actual file data, but the plugin always at a minimum stores metadata for each file in the database.\n\nThere are three storage options for files uploaded through attachment_fu:\n  File system\n  Database file\n  Amazon S3\n\nEach method of storage many options associated with it that will be covered in the following section.  Something to note, however, is that the Amazon S3 storage requires you to modify config/amazon_s3.yml and the Database file storage requires an extra table.\n\n\nattachment_fu models\n====================\n\nFor all three of these storage options a table of metadata is required.  This table will contain information about the file (hence the 'meta') and its location.  This table has no restrictions on naming, unlike the extra table required for database storage, which must have a table name of db_files (and by convention a model of DbFile).\n\nIn the model there are two methods made available by this plugins: has_attachment and validates_as_attachment.\n\nhas_attachment(options = {})\n  This method accepts the options in a hash:\n    :content_type     # Allowed content types.\n                      # Allows all by default.  Use :image to allow all standard image types.\n    :min_size         # Minimum size allowed.\n                      # 1 byte is the default.\n    :max_size         # Maximum size allowed.\n                      # 1.megabyte is the default.\n    :size             # Range of sizes allowed.\n                      # (1..1.megabyte) is the default.  This overrides the :min_size and :max_size options.\n    :resize_to        # Used by RMagick to resize images.\n                      # Pass either an array of width/height, or a geometry string.\n    :thumbnails       # Specifies a set of thumbnails to generate.\n                      # This accepts a hash of filename suffixes and RMagick resizing options.\n                      # This option need only be included if you want thumbnailing.\n    :thumbnail_class  # Set which model class to use for thumbnails.\n                      # This current attachment class is used by default.\n    :path_prefix      # path to store the uploaded files.\n                      # Uses public/#{table_name} by default for the filesystem, and just #{table_name} for the S3 backend.  \n                      # Setting this sets the :storage to :file_system.\n    :storage          # Specifies the storage system to use..\n                      # Defaults to :db_file.  Options are :file_system, :db_file, and :s3.\n    :processor        # Sets the image processor to use for resizing of the attached image.\n                      # Options include ImageScience, Rmagick, and MiniMagick.  Default is whatever is installed.\n\n\n  Examples:\n    has_attachment :max_size => 1.kilobyte\n    has_attachment :size => 1.megabyte..2.megabytes\n    has_attachment :content_type => 'application/pdf'\n    has_attachment :content_type => ['application/pdf', 'application/msword', 'text/plain']\n    has_attachment :content_type => :image, :resize_to => [50,50]\n    has_attachment :content_type => ['application/pdf', :image], :resize_to => 'x50'\n    has_attachment :thumbnails => { :thumb => [50, 50], :geometry => 'x50' }\n    has_attachment :storage => :file_system, :path_prefix => 'public/files'\n    has_attachment :storage => :file_system, :path_prefix => 'public/files', \n                   :content_type => :image, :resize_to => [50,50]\n    has_attachment :storage => :file_system, :path_prefix => 'public/files',\n                   :thumbnails => { :thumb => [50, 50], :geometry => 'x50' }\n    has_attachment :storage => :s3\n\nvalidates_as_attachment\n  This method prevents files outside of the valid range (:min_size to :max_size, or the :size range) from being saved.  It does not however, halt the upload of such files.  They will be uploaded into memory regardless of size before validation.\n\n  Example:\n    validates_as_attachment\n\n\nattachment_fu migrations\n========================\n\nFields for attachment_fu metadata tables...\n  in general:\n    size,         :integer  # file size in bytes\n    content_type, :string   # mime type, ex: application/mp3\n    filename,     :string   # sanitized filename\n  that reference images:\n    height,       :integer  # in pixels\n    width,        :integer  # in pixels\n  that reference images that will be thumbnailed:\n    parent_id,    :integer  # id of parent image (on the same table, a self-referencing foreign-key).\n                            # Only populated if the current object is a thumbnail.\n    thumbnail,    :string   # the 'type' of thumbnail this attachment record describes.  \n                            # Only populated if the current object is a thumbnail.\n                            # Usage:\n                            # [ In Model 'Avatar' ]\n                            #   has_attachment :content_type => :image, \n                            #                  :storage => :file_system, \n                            #                  :max_size => 500.kilobytes,\n                            #                  :resize_to => '320x200>',\n                            #                  :thumbnails => { :small => '10x10>',\n                            #                                   :thumb => '100x100>' }\n                            # [ Elsewhere ]\n                            # @user.avatar.thumbnails.first.thumbnail #=> 'small'\n  that reference files stored in the database (:db_file):\n    db_file_id,   :integer  # id of the file in the database (foreign key)\n\nField for attachment_fu db_files table:\n  data, :binary # binary file data, for use in database file storage\n\n\nattachment_fu views\n===================\n\nThere are two main views tasks that will be directly affected by attachment_fu: upload forms and displaying uploaded images.\n\nThere are two parts of the upload form that differ from typical usage.\n  1. Include ':multipart => true' in the html options of the form_for tag.\n    Example:\n      <% form_for(:attachment_metadata, :url => { :action => \"create\" }, :html => { :multipart => true }) do |form| %>\n\n  2. Use the file_field helper with :uploaded_data as the field name.\n    Example:\n      <%= form.file_field :uploaded_data %>\n\nDisplaying uploaded images is made easy by the public_filename method of the ActiveRecord attachment objects using file system and s3 storage.\n\npublic_filename(thumbnail = nil)\n  Returns the public path to the file.  If a thumbnail prefix is specified it will return the public file path to the corresponding thumbnail.\n  Examples:\n    attachment_obj.public_filename          #=> /attachments/2/file.jpg\n    attachment_obj.public_filename(:thumb)  #=> /attachments/2/file_thumb.jpg\n    attachment_obj.public_filename(:small)  #=> /attachments/2/file_small.jpg\n\nWhen serving files from database storage, doing more than simply downloading the file is beyond the scope of this document.\n\n\nattachment_fu controllers\n=========================\n\nThere are two considerations to take into account when using attachment_fu in controllers.\n\nThe first is when the files have no publicly accessible path and need to be downloaded through an action.\n\nExample:\n  def readme\n    send_file '/path/to/readme.txt', :type => 'plain/text', :disposition => 'inline'\n  end\n\nSee the possible values for send_file for reference.\n\n\nThe second is when saving the file when submitted from a form.\nExample in view:\n <%= form.file_field :attachable, :uploaded_data %>\n\nExample in controller:\n  def create\n    @attachable_file = AttachmentMetadataModel.new(params[:attachable])\n    if @attachable_file.save\n      flash[:notice] = 'Attachment was successfully created.'\n      redirect_to attachable_url(@attachable_file)     \n    else\n      render :action => :new\n    end\n  end\n\n",

    "Readme": "\nStringex   \nSome [hopefully] useful extensions to Ruby's String class. It is made\nup of three libraries: ActsAsUrl, Unidecoder, and StringExtensions.\nNOTE: Stringex 2.0 [and beyond] drops support for Rails 2. If you need\nsupport for that version, use 1.5.1 instead.\nActsAsUrl\nNOTE: You can now require 'stringex_lite' instead of\n'stringex' and skip loading ActsAsUrl functionality if you\ndon't need it.\nThis library is designed to create URI-friendly representations of an\nattribute, for use in generating urls from your attributes. Basic usage is\njust calling the method:\n# Inside your model\nacts_as_url :title\nwhich will populate the url attribute on the object with the\nconverted contents of the title attribute. acts_as_url\ntakes the following options:\n:url_attribute\n\nThe name of the attribute to use for storing the generated url string.\nDefault is :url\n:scope\n\nThe name of model attribute to scope unique urls to. There is no default\nhere.\n:only_when_blank\n\nIf set to true, the url generation will only happen when\n:url_attribute is blank. Default is false (meaning url generation\nwill happen always).\n:sync_url\n\nIf set to true, the url field will be updated when changes are made to the\nattribute it is based on. Default is false.\n:allow_slash\n\nIf set to true, the url field will not convert slashes. Default is false.\n:allow_duplicates\n\nIf set to true, unique urls will not be enforced. Default is false.\nNOTE: This is strongly not recommended if you are routing solely on the\ngenerated slug as you will no longer be guaranteed to lookup the expected\nrecord based on a duplicate slug.\n:limit\n\nIf set, will limit length of url generated. Default is nil.\n:truncate_words\n\nUsed with :limit. If set to false, the url will be truncated to the last\nwhole word before the limit was reached. Default is true.\n:blacklist\n\nList of urls that should not be allowed. Default is %w{new} [which\navoids confusion on urls like /documents/new].\n:blacklist_policy\n\nProc or lambda defining new naming behavior when blacklisted urls are\nencountered. Default converts /documents/new to\n/documents/new-document.\n\nIn order to use the generated url attribute, you will probably want to\noverride to_param like so, in your Model:\n# Inside your model\ndef to_param\n  url # or whatever you set :url_attribute to\nend\nRouting called via named routes like foo_path(@foo) will\nautomatically use the url. In your controllers you will need to call\nFoo.find_by_url(params[:id]) instead of the regular find.\nDon't look for params[:url] unless you set it explicitly in\nthe routing, to_param will generate params[:id].\nNote that if you add acts_as_url to an existing model, the\nurl database column will initially be blank. To set this column\nfor your existing instances, you can use the initialize_urls\nmethod. So if your class is Post, just say\nPost.initialize_urls.\nUnlike other permalink solutions, ActsAsUrl doesn't rely on Iconv\n(which is inconsistent across platforms and doesn't provide great\ntransliteration as is) but instead uses a transliteration scheme (see the\ncode for Unidecoder) which produces much better results for Unicode\ncharacters. It also mixes in some custom helpers to translate common\ncharacters into a more URI-friendly format rather than just dump them\ncompletely. Examples:\n# A simple prelude\n\"simple English\".to_url => \"simple-english\"\n\"it's nothing at all\".to_url => \"its-nothing-at-all\"\n\"rock & roll\".to_url => \"rock-and-roll\"\n\n# Let's show off\n\"$12 worth of Ruby power\".to_url => \"12-dollars-worth-of-ruby-power\"\n\"10% off if you act now\".to_url => \"10-percent-off-if-you-act-now\"\n\n# You dont EVEN wanna rely on Iconv for this next part\n\"kick it en Fran\u00e7ais\".to_url => \"kick-it-en-francais\"\n\"rock it Espa\u00f1ol style\".to_url => \"rock-it-espanol-style\"\n\"tell your readers \u4f60\u597d\".to_url => \"tell-your-readers-ni-hao\"\nCompare those results with the ones produced on my Intel Mac by a leading\npermalink plugin:\n\"simple English\" # => \"simple-english\"\n\"it's nothing at all\" # => \"it-s-nothing-at-all\"\n\"rock & roll\" # => \"rock-roll\"\n\n\"$12 worth of Ruby power\" # => \"12-worth-of-ruby-power\"\n\"10% off if you act now\" # => \"10-off-if-you-act-now\"\n\n\"kick it en Fran\u00e7ais\" # => \"kick-it-en-francais\"\n\"rock it Espa\u00f1ol style\" # => \"rock-it-espan-ol-style\"\n\"tell your readers \u4f60\u597d\" # => \"tell-your-readers\"\nNot so great, actually.\nNote: No offense is intended to the author of\nwhatever plugins might produce such results. It's not your faults Iconv\nsucks.\nUnidecoder\nThis library converts Unicode [and accented ASCII] characters to their\nplain-text ASCII equivalents. This is a port of Perl's Unidecode and\nprovides eminently superior and more reliable results than Iconv.\n(Seriously, Iconv\u2026 A plague on both your houses! [sic])\nYou may require only the unidecoder (and its dependent localization) via\nrequire \"stringex/unidecoder\"\nYou probably won't ever need to run Unidecoder by itself. Thus, you\nprobably would want to add String#to_ascii which wraps all of\nUnidecoder's functionality, by requiring:\nrequire \"stringex/core_ext\"\nFor anyone interested, details of the implementation can be read about in\nthe original implementation of Text::Unidecode.\nExtensive examples can be found in the tests.\nStringExtensions\nA small collection of extensions on Ruby's String class. Please see the\ndocumentation for StringExtensions module for more information. There's\nnot much to explain about them really.\nLocalization\nWith Stringex version 2.0 and higher, you can localize the different\nconversions in Stringex. Read more here.\nIf you add a new language, please submit a pull request so we can make it\navailable to other users also.\nRuby on Rails Usage\nWhen using Stringex with Ruby on Rails, you automatically get built-in\ntranslations for miscellaneous characters, HTML entities, and vulgar\nfractions. You can see Stringex's standard translations here.\nCurrently, built-in translations are available for the following languages:\n* English (en)\n* Danish (da)\n* Swedish (sv)\n* Dutch (nl)\n* German (de)\n* Polish (pl)\n* Portuguese Brazilian (pt-BR)\n* Russian (ru)\nYou can easily add your own or customize the built-in translations - read\nhere.\nIf you add a new language, please submit a pull request so we can make it\navailable to other users also.\nIf you don't want to use the Stringex built-in translations, you can\nforce Stringex to use English (or another language), regardless what is in\nyour I18n.locale. In an initializer, e.g.\nconfig/initializers/stringex.rb:\nStringex::Localization.locale = :en\nCanCan Usage Note\nYou'll need to add a :find_by => :url to your\nload_and_authorize_resource.  Here's an example:\nload_and_authorize_resource :class => \"Whatever\", :message => \"Not authorized\", :find_by => :url\nSemantic Versioning\nThis project conforms to [semver](semver.org/). As a result of this policy, you\ncan (and should) specify a dependency on this gem using the [Pessimistic\nVersion Constraint](guides.rubygems.org/patterns/)\nwith two digits of precision. For example:\nspec.add_dependency 'stringex', '~> 1.0'\nThis means your project is compatible with licensee 1.0 up until 2.0. You\ncan also set a higher minimum version:\nspec.add_dependency 'stringex', '~> 1.1'\nThanks & Acknowledgements\nIf it's not obvious, some of the code for ActsAsUrl is based on Rick\nOlsen's permalink_fu\nplugin. Unidecoder is a Ruby port of Sean Burke's Text::Unidecode\nmodule for Perl.

    "Readme": "Bus Scheme\n    by Phil Hagelberg (c) 2007 - 2008\n    http://bus-scheme.rubyforge.org\n\n== Description\n\nBus Scheme is a Scheme written in Ruby, but implemented on the bus!\nEvery programmer must implement Scheme as a rite of passage; this is\nmine. Note that at least half of the implementation of Bus Scheme must\nbe written while on a bus. Documentation, tests, and administrivia may\nbe accomplished elsewhere, but the majority of actual implementation\ncode is strictly bus-driven. Patches are welcome especially if they were\nwritten while riding a bus. (If your daily commute does not involve a\nbus but you want to submit a patch, we may be able to work something\nout regarding code written on trains, ferries, or perhaps even carpool\nlanes.) Bus Scheme is primarily a toy; using it for anything serious\nis (right now) ill-advised.\n\nBus Scheme aims for general Scheme usefulness optimized for learning\nand fun. It's not targeting R5RS or anything like that.\n\n== Usage\n\n$ bus # drop into the REPL\n\n$ bus -e \"(do some stuff)\"\n\n$ bus foo.scm # load a file\n\n== Tutorial\n\nSee http://technomancy.us/104 for a \"Getting Started\" tutorial.\n\n== What makes Bus Scheme different?\n\nWell, for starters it's implemented on the bus. No other Scheme\nimplementation can claim this. Here are a few other things that set\nBus Scheme apart:\n\n=== Flexible calling syntax\n\nTaking a hint from Arc, Bus Scheme allows you to use the notation\n(mylist n) to access the nth place of the mylist list instead of (nth\nmylist n) or the (myhash key) notation to access the slot in myhash\ncorresponding to the value of key instead of (gethash myhash key). \nTODO: This notation is flexible, and other data types may have\ntheir own \"call behaviour\" specified.\n\n=== Mongrel integration\n\nWeb and RESTful application development are part of the package. Bus\nScheme uses the wonderful Mongrel web server to allow scheme programs\nto serve web applications. TODO: Representations of data can be easily\ntranslated between s-expressions, HTML, and JSON.\n\n=== Written in a high-level language\n\nBus Scheme is written in Ruby, which means anyone with experience in\nhigh-level dynamic languages (like, oh, I don't know... Scheme?)\nshould be right at home poking around at the implementation. Using\nRuby allows the implementation code to remain compact and concise. Bus\nScheme should run on Ruby 1.8, Ruby 1.9, and Rubinius at least. Bus\nScheme also allows you to drop into Ruby when that's convenient. TODO:\nallow real inline Ruby blocks instead of access via a function call.\n\n=== XML integration\n\nTODO: Bus Scheme has a notion of XML literals so that it may be\ninlined into your Scheme code, much like the way ECMAScript uses\nE4X. If you'd prefer, you can leverage convenient s-expression -> XML\nconversion facilities.\n\n=== Test-Driven\n\nBus Scheme is written in an entirely test-driven manner. As much as\npossible, it tries to keep its tests written in Scheme itself, so it\nincludes a fairly comprehensive testing suite and encourages programs\nto be written test-first.\n\n== Install\n\n* sudo gem install bus-scheme\n\nFor the source:\n\n* git clone git://git.caboo.se/bus_scheme.git\n\n== Todo\n\nBus Scheme is currently missing pieces of functionality:\n\n=== Parser\n* character literals\n* multiline strings\n* dotted cons cells\n\n=== General\n* test framework needs work\n* macros\n* continuations\n\nFailing tests for some of these are already included (commented out,\nmostly) in the relevant test files.\n\n=== Long Term (post 1.0)\n* web functions (defresource and friends)\n* (lambda (arg1 arg2 . args) body) for rest args\n* string interpolation\n* escape sequences in strings\n* Ruby blocks inline?\n* XML literals?\n* optimize tail call recursion\n* compile to Rubinius bytecode\n* custom call behaviour\n* parse non-decimal base numbers\n* parse rationals, scientific, complex, and polar complex numbers\n\n== Requirements\n\nBus Scheme should run on (at least) Ruby 1.8, Ruby 1.9, and Rubinius.\n\n== Bonus Fact\n\nI haven't actually used a real Scheme yet. Everything I know about it\nI've gathered from reading The Little Schemer, watching the Structure\nand Interpretation of Computer Programs videos, and reading lots about\nCommon Lisp and Emacs Lisp. If there are huge gaping flaws in the\nimplementation, this is likely to be why.\n\n",

    "Name": "bindata",
    "Readme": "= BinData\n\nA declarative way to read and write structured binary data.\n\n== What is it for?\n\nDo you ever find yourself writing code like this?\n\n  io = File.open(...)\n  len = io.read(2).unpack(\"v\")\n  name = io.read(len)\n  width, height = io.read(8).unpack(\"VV\")\n  puts \"Rectangle #{name} is #{width} x #{height}\"\n\nIt's ugly, violates DRY and feels like you're writing Perl, not Ruby.\nThere is a better way.\n\n  class Rectangle < BinData::Struct\n    uint16le :len\n    string   :name, :read_length => :len\n    uint32le :width\n    uint32le :height\n  end\n\n  io = File.open(...)\n  r = Rectangle.read(io)\n  puts \"Rectangle #{r.name} is #{r.width} x #{r.height}\"\n\nBinData makes it easy to specify the structure of the data you are\nmanipulating.\n\nRead on for the tutorial, or go straight to the\ndownload[http://rubyforge.org/frs/?group_id=3252] page.\n\n== Syntax\n\nBinData declarations are easy to read.  Here's an example.\n\n  class MyFancyFormat < BinData::Struct\n    stringz :comment\n    uint8   :count, :check_value => lambda { (value % 2) == 0 }\n    array   :some_ints, :type => :int32be, :initial_length => :count\n  end\n\nThe structure of the data in this example is\n1. A zero terminated string\n2. An unsigned 8bit integer which must by even\n3. A sequence of unsigned 32bit integers in big endian form, the total\n   number of which is determined by the value of the 8bit integer.\n\nThe BinData declaration matches the english description closely.  Just for\nfun, lets look at how we'd implement this using #pack and #unpack.  Here's\nthe writing code, have a go at the reading code.\n\n  comment = \"this is a comment\"\n  some_ints = [2, 3, 8, 9, 1, 8]\n  File.open(...) do |io|\n    io.write([comment, some_ints.size, *some_ints].pack(\"Z*CN*\"))\n  end\n\n\nThe general format of a BinData declaration is a class containing one or more\nfields.\n\n  class MyName < BinData::Struct\n    type field_name, :param1 => \"foo\", :param2 => bar, ...\n    ...\n  end\n\n*type* is the name of a supplied type (e.g. <tt>uint32be</tt>,  +string+)\nor a user defined type.  For user defined types, convert the class name\nfrom CamelCase to lowercase underscore_style.\n\n*field_name* is the name by which you can access the data.  Use either a\nString or a Symbol.  You may specify a name as nil, but this is described\nlater in the tutorial.\n\nEach field may have *parameters* for how to process the data.  The\nparameters are passed as a Hash using Symbols for keys.\n\n== Handling dependencies between fields\n\nA common occurance in binary file formats is one field depending upon the\nvalue of another.  e.g. A string preceded by it's length.\n\nAs an example, let's assume a Pascal style string where the byte preceding\nthe string contains the string's length.\n\n  # reading\n  io = File.open(...)\n  len = io.getc\n  str = io.read(len)\n  puts \"string is \" + str\n\n  # writing\n  io = File.open(...)\n  str = \"this is a string\"\n  io.putc(str.length)\n  io.write(str)\n\nHere's how we'd implement the same example with BinData.\n\n  class PascalString < BinData::Struct\n    uint8  :len,  :value => lambda { data.length }\n    string :data, :read_length => :len\n  end\n\n  # reading\n  io = File.open(...)\n  ps = PascalString.new\n  ps.read(io)\n  puts \"string is \" + ps.data\n\n  # writing\n  io = File.open(...)\n  ps = PascalString.new\n  ps.data = \"this is a string\"\n  ps.write(io)\n\nThis syntax needs explaining.  Let's simplify by examining reading and\nwriting separately.\n\n  class PascalStringReader < BinData::Struct\n    uint8  :len\n    string :data, :read_length => :len\n  end\n\nThis states that when reading the string, the initial length of the string\n(and hence the number of bytes to read) is determined by the value of the\n+len+ field.\n\nNote that <tt>:read_length => :len</tt> is syntactic sugar for\n<tt>:read_length => lambda { len }</tt>, but more on that later.\n\n  class PascalStringWriter < BinData::Struct\n    uint8  :len, :value => lambda { data.length }\n    string :data\n  end\n\nThis states that the value of +len+ is always equal to the length of +data+.\n+len+ may not be manually modified.\n\nCombining these two definitions gives the definition for +PascalString+ as\npreviously defined.\n\nOnce thing to note with dependencies, is that a field can only depend on one\nbefore it.  You can't have a string which has the characters first and the\nlength afterwards.\n\n== Predefined Types\n\nThese are the predefined types.  Custom types can be created by composing\nthese types.\n\nBinData::Int8::     Signed  8 bit integer.\nBinData::Int16le::  Signed 16 bit integer (little endian).\nBinData::Int16be::  Signed 16 bit integer (big endian).\nBinData::Int32le::  Signed 32 bit integer (little endian).\nBinData::Int32be::  Signed 32 bit integer (big endian).\nBinData::Int64le::  Signed 64 bit integer (little endian).\nBinData::Int64be::  Signed 64 bit integer (big endian).\n\nBinData::Uint8::    Unsigned  8 bit integer.\nBinData::Uint16le:: Unsigned 16 bit integer (little endian).\nBinData::Uint16be:: Unsigned 16 bit integer (big endian).\nBinData::Uint32le:: Unsigned 32 bit integer (little endian).\nBinData::Uint32be:: Unsigned 32 bit integer (big endian).\nBinData::Uint64le:: Unsigned 64 bit integer (little endian).\nBinData::Uint64be:: Unsigned 64 bit integer (big endian).\n\nBinData::FloatLe::  Single precision floating point number (little endian).\nBinData::FloatBe::  Single precision floating point number (big endian).\nBinData::DoubleLe:: Double precision floating point number (little endian).\nBinData::DoubleBe:: Double precision floating point number (big endian).\n\nBinData::String::   A sequence of bytes.\nBinData::Stringz::  A zero terminated sequence of bytes.\n\nBinData::Array::    A list of objects of the same type.\nBinData::Choice::   A choice between several objects.\nBinData::Struct::   An ordered collection of named objects.\n\n== Parameters\n\n  class PascalStringWriter < BinData::Struct\n    uint8  :len, :value => lambda { data.length }\n    string :data\n  end\n\nRevisiting the Pascal string writer, we see that a field can take\nparameters.  Parameters are passed as a Hash, where the key is a symbol.\nIt should be noted that parameters are designed to be lazily evaluated,\npossibly multiple times.  This means that any parameter value must not have\nside effects.\n\nHere are some examples of legal values for parameters.\n\n  * :param => 5\n  * :param => lambda { 5 + 2 }\n  * :param => lambda { foo + 2 }\n  * :param => :foo\n\nThe simplest case is when the value is a literal value, such as 5.\n\nIf the value is not a literal, it is expected to be a lambda.  The lambda\nwill be evaluated in the context of the parent, in this case the parent is\nan instance of +PascalStringWriter+.\n\nIf the value is a symbol, it is taken as syntactic sugar for a lambda\ncontaining the value of the symbol.\ne.g <tt>:param => :foo</tt> is <tt>:param => lambda { foo }</tt>\n\n== Saving Typing\n\nThe endianess of numeric types must be explicitly defined so that the code\nproduced is independent of architecture.  Explicitly specifying the\nendianess of each numeric type can become tedious, so the following\nshortcut is provided.\n\n  class A < BinData::Struct\n    endian :little\n\n    uint16   :a\n    uint32   :b\n    double   :c\n    uint32be :d\n    array    :e, :type => :int16\n  end\n\nis equivalent to:\n\n  class A < BinData::Struct\n    uint16le  :a\n    uint32le  :b\n    double_le :c\n    uint32be  :d\n    array     :e, :type => :int16le\n  end\n\nUsing the endian keyword improves the readability of the declaration as well\nas reducing the amount of typing necessary.  Note that the endian keyword will\ncascade to nested types, as illustrated with the array in the above example.\n\n== Creating custom types\n\nCustom types should be created by subclassing BinData::Struct.\nOcassionally it may be useful to subclass BinData::Single.  Subclassing\nother classes may have unexpected results and is unsupported.\n\n\n== License\n\nBinData is released under the same license as Ruby.\n\nCopyright (c) 2007 Dion Mendel\n\n",

    "Readme": "= Bus Scheme\n    by Phil Hagelberg (c) 2007 - 2008\n    http://bus-scheme.rubyforge.org\n\n== Description\n\nBus Scheme is a Scheme written in Ruby, but implemented on the bus!\nEvery programmer must implement Scheme as a rite of passage; this is\nmine. Note that at least half of the implementation of Bus Scheme must\nbe written while on a bus. Documentation, tests, and administrivia may\nbe accomplished elsewhere, but the majority of actual implementation\ncode is strictly bus-driven. Bus Scheme is primarily a toy; using it\nfor anything serious is (right now) ill-advised.\n\nBus Scheme aims for general Scheme usefulness optimized for learning\nand fun. It's loosely targeting R5RS, but varies in huge ways. (For\nthe purposes of this project we pretend that R6RS never happened.) See\nthe file R5RS.diff for ways in which Bus Scheme differs from the\nstandard, both things that are yet unimplemented and things that are\nintentionally different.\n\n== Usage\n\n$ bus # drop into the REPL\n\n$ bus -e \"(do some stuff)\"\n\n$ bus foo.scm # load a file\n\n== Tutorial\n\nSee http://technomancy.us/104 for a \"Getting Started\" tutorial.\n\n== Contributing\n\nIf you're looking for stuff to do, try \"rake todo\"\n\nPatches are welcome especially if they were written while riding a\nbus. If your daily commute does not involve a bus but you want to\nsubmit a patch, we may be able to work something out regarding code\nwritten on trains, ferries, or perhaps even carpool lanes.\n\nJoin the mailing list to ask questions and discuss:\nhttp://rubyforge.org/mail/?group_id=5094\n\n== What makes Bus Scheme different?\n\nWell, for starters it's implemented on the bus. No other Scheme\nimplementation can claim this. Here are a few other things that set\nBus Scheme apart:\n\n=== Flexible calling syntax\n\nTaking a hint from Arc, Bus Scheme allows you to use the notation\n(mylist n) to access the nth place of the mylist list instead of (nth\nmylist n) or the (myhash key) notation to access the slot in myhash\ncorresponding to the value of key instead of (gethash myhash key). \nTODO: This notation is flexible, and other data types may have\ntheir own \"call behaviour\" specified.\n\n=== Web functionality\n\nPlanned: Web and RESTful application development are part of the\npackage. Bus Scheme uses the Rack library to allow scheme programs to\nserve web applications. Representations of data can be easily\ntranslated between s-expressions, HTML, and JSON.\n\n=== Written in a high-level language\n\nBus Scheme is written in Ruby, which means anyone with experience in\nhigh-level dynamic languages (like, oh, I don't know... Scheme?)\nshould be right at home poking around at the implementation. Using\nRuby allows the implementation code to remain compact and concise. Bus\nScheme should run on Ruby 1.8, Ruby 1.9, Rubinius, and JRuby at\nleast. Bus Scheme also allows you to drop into Ruby when that's\nconvenient. TODO: allow real inline Ruby blocks instead of access via\na function call.\n\n=== Test-Driven\n\nBus Scheme is written in an entirely test-driven manner. As much as\npossible, it tries to keep its tests written in Scheme itself, so it\nincludes a fairly comprehensive testing suite and encourages programs\nto be written test-first.\n\n== Install\n\n* sudo gem install bus-scheme\n\nFor the source:\n\n* git clone git://github.com/technomancy/bus-scheme.git\n\n== Todo\n\nBus Scheme is currently missing pieces of functionality:\n\n=== Parser\n* multiline strings\n* regular expressions\n\n=== General\n* filter stacktrace\n* continuations\n* macros\n\nFailing tests for some of these are already included (commented out,\nmostly) in the relevant test files.\n\n=== Long Term (post 1.0)\n* web functions (defresource and friends)\n* (lambda (arg1 arg2 . args) body) for rest args\n* string interpolation\n* escape sequences in strings\n* Ruby blocks inline?\n* XML literals?\n* optimize tail call recursion\n* compile to Rubinius bytecode\n* custom call behaviour\n* parse non-decimal base numbers\n* parse rationals, scientific, complex, and polar complex numbers\n\n== Requirements\n\nBus Scheme should run on (at least) Ruby 1.8, Ruby 1.9, Rubinius,\nJRuby. Any support for Windows is entirely accidental.\n\n== Bonus Fact\n\nI haven't actually used a real Scheme yet. Everything I know about it\nI've gathered from reading The Little Schemer, watching the Structure\nand Interpretation of Computer Programs videos, and reading lots about\nCommon Lisp and Emacs Lisp. If there are huge gaping flaws in the\nimplementation, this is likely to be why.\n\n",

Also, you can add events to a \ncalendar, which are denoted by adding a custom class name to that day, allowing\nyou to style it differently, or even define behavior for that day via unobtrusive\nJavascript.\n\n\nUsage\n=====\n\nYou can create a new calendar object by simply running \"Calendar.new\" from either\nyour controller or your view. You can specify the month and year of your calendar\nlike so:\n\n  @calendar = Calendar.new(:month => 'oct', :year => 2001)\n\nIf you'd like to add events to the calendar object, you can simply pass it an\narray of objects via its #add method, then designating an attribute to signify the\nevent date using the :schedule_for option. This option is not optional. If you don't\ninclude it, an ArgumentError exception will be raised.\n\nYou can also specify which class should be added to days that have certain events\nby using the :html_class option. If you don't provide one, then the plugin will just\nadd the :schedule_for value as a class name.\n\nFinally, use the #generate method to actually render the HTML code for your calendar.\n\nExample\n=======\n\nIn your controller...\n\n  class PartyController < ApplicationController\n    def index\n      @parties  = Party.find(:all)\n      @calendar = Calendar.new\n      @calendar.add @parties, :schedule_for => :party_date, :html_class => \"party_time\"\n      render :action => :index\n    end\n  end\n\nIn your view...\n\n  <%= @calendar.generate %>\n\nTodo\n====\n\n- Clean it up.

    "Readme": "== Welcome to Rails\n\nRails is a web-application and persistence framework that includes everything\nneeded to create database-backed web-applications according to the\nModel-View-Control pattern of separation. This pattern splits the view (also\ncalled the presentation) into \"dumb\" templates that are primarily responsible\nfor inserting pre-built data in between HTML tags. The model contains the\n\"smart\" domain objects (such as Account, Product, Person, Post) that holds all\nthe business logic and knows how to persist themselves to a database. The\ncontroller handles the incoming requests (such as Save New Account, Update\nProduct, Show Post) by manipulating the model and directing data to the view.\n\nIn Rails, the model is handled by what's called an object-relational mapping\nlayer entitled Active Record. This layer allows you to present the data from\ndatabase rows as objects and embellish these data objects with business logic\nmethods. You can read more about Active Record in\nlink:files/vendor/rails/activerecord/README.html.\n\nThe controller and view are handled by the Action Pack, which handles both\nlayers by its two parts: Action View and Action Controller. These two layers\nare bundled in a single package due to their heavy interdependence. This is\nunlike the relationship between the Active Record and Action Pack that is much\nmore separate. Each of these packages can be used independently outside of\nRails.  You can read more about Action Pack in\nlink:files/vendor/rails/actionpack/README.html.\n\n\n== Getting Started\n\n1. At the command prompt, start a new Rails application using the <tt>rails</tt> command\n   and your application name. Ex: rails myapp\n   (If you've downloaded Rails in a complete tgz or zip, this step is already done)\n2. Change directory into myapp and start the web server: <tt>script/server</tt> (run with --help for options)\n3. Go to http://localhost:3000/ and get \"Welcome aboard: You\u2019re riding the Rails!\"\n4. Follow the guidelines to start developing your application\n\n\n== Web Servers\n\nBy default, Rails will try to use Mongrel and lighttpd if they are installed, otherwise\nRails will use WEBrick, the webserver that ships with Ruby. When you run script/server,\nRails will check if Mongrel exists, then lighttpd and finally fall back to WEBrick. This ensures\nthat you can always get up and running quickly.\n\nMongrel is a Ruby-based webserver with a C component (which requires compilation) that is\nsuitable for development and deployment of Rails applications. If you have Ruby Gems installed,\ngetting up and running with mongrel is as easy as: <tt>gem install mongrel</tt>.\nMore info at: http://mongrel.rubyforge.org\n\nIf Mongrel is not installed, Rails will look for lighttpd. It's considerably faster than\nMongrel and WEBrick and also suited for production use, but requires additional\ninstallation and currently only works well on OS X/Unix (Windows users are encouraged\nto start with Mongrel). We recommend version 1.4.11 and higher. You can download it from\nhttp://www.lighttpd.net.\n\nAnd finally, if neither Mongrel or lighttpd are installed, Rails will use the built-in Ruby\nweb server, WEBrick. WEBrick is a small Ruby web server suitable for development, but not\nfor production.\n\nBut of course its also possible to run Rails on any platform that supports FCGI.\nApache, LiteSpeed, IIS are just a few. For more information on FCGI,\nplease visit: http://wiki.rubyonrails.com/rails/pages/FastCGI\n\n\n== Debugging Rails\n\nSometimes your application goes wrong.  Fortunately there are a lot of tools that\nwill help you debug it and get it back on the rails.\n\nFirst area to check is the application log files.  Have \"tail -f\" commands running\non the server.log and development.log. Rails will automatically display debugging\nand runtime information to these files. Debugging info will also be shown in the\nbrowser on requests from 127.0.0.1.\n\nYou can also log your own messages directly into the log file from your code using\nthe Ruby logger class from inside your controllers. Example:\n\n  class WeblogController < ActionController::Base\n    def destroy\n      @weblog = Weblog.find(params[:id])\n      @weblog.destroy\n      logger.info(\"#{Time.now} Destroyed Weblog ID ##{@weblog.id}!\")\n    end\n  end\n\nThe result will be a message in your log file along the lines of:\n\n  Mon Oct 08 14:22:29 +1000 2007 Destroyed Weblog ID #1\n\nMore information on how to use the logger is at http://www.ruby-doc.org/core/\n\nAlso, Ruby documentation can be found at http://www.ruby-lang.org/ including:\n\n* The Learning Ruby (Pickaxe) Book: http://www.ruby-doc.org/docs/ProgrammingRuby/\n* Learn to Program: http://pine.fm/LearnToProgram/  (a beginners guide)\n\nThese two online (and free) books will bring you up to speed on the Ruby language\nand also on programming in general.\n\n\n== Debugger\n\nDebugger support is available through the debugger command when you start your Mongrel or\nWebrick server with --debugger. This means that you can break out of execution at any point\nin the code, investigate and change the model, AND then resume execution! Example:\n\n  class WeblogController < ActionController::Base\n    def index\n      @posts = Post.find(:all)\n      debugger\n    end\n  end\n\nSo the controller will accept the action, run the first line, then present you\nwith a IRB prompt in the server window. Here you can do things like:\n\n  >> @posts.inspect\n  => \"[#<Post:0x14a6be8 @attributes={\\\"title\\\"=>nil, \\\"body\\\"=>nil, \\\"id\\\"=>\\\"1\\\"}>,\n       #<Post:0x14a6620 @attributes={\\\"title\\\"=>\\\"Rails you know!\\\", \\\"body\\\"=>\\\"Only ten..\\\", \\\"id\\\"=>\\\"2\\\"}>]\"\n  >> @posts.first.title = \"hello from a debugger\"\n  => \"hello from a debugger\"\n\n...and even better is that you can examine how your runtime objects actually work:\n\n  >> f = @posts.first\n  => #<Post:0x13630c4 @attributes={\"title\"=>nil, \"body\"=>nil, \"id\"=>\"1\"}>\n  >> f.\n  Display all 152 possibilities? (y or n)\n\nFinally, when you're ready to resume execution, you enter \"cont\"\n\n\n== Console\n\nYou can interact with the domain model by starting the console through <tt>script/console</tt>.\nHere you'll have all parts of the application configured, just like it is when the\napplication is running. You can inspect domain models, change values, and save to the\ndatabase. Starting the script without arguments will launch it in the development environment.\nPassing an argument will specify a different environment, like <tt>script/console production</tt>.\n\nTo reload your controllers and models after launching the console run <tt>reload!</tt>\n\n\n== Description of Contents\n\napp\n  Holds all the code that's specific to this particular application.\n\napp/controllers\n  Holds controllers that should be named like weblogs_controller.rb for\n  automated URL mapping. All controllers should descend from ApplicationController\n  which itself descends from ActionController::Base.\n\napp/models\n  Holds models that should be named like post.rb.\n  Most models will descend from ActiveRecord::Base.\n\napp/views\n  Holds the template files for the view that should be named like\n  weblogs/index.erb for the WeblogsController#index action. All views use eRuby\n  syntax.\n\napp/views/layouts\n  Holds the template files for layouts to be used with views. This models the common\n  header/footer method of wrapping views.

    "Readme": "== Welcome to Rails\n\nRails is a web-application and persistence framework that includes everything\nneeded to create database-backed web-applications according to the\nModel-View-Control pattern of separation. This pattern splits the view (also\ncalled the presentation) into \"dumb\" templates that are primarily responsible\nfor inserting pre-built data in between HTML tags. The model contains the\n\"smart\" domain objects (such as Account, Product, Person, Post) that holds all\nthe business logic and knows how to persist themselves to a database. The\ncontroller handles the incoming requests (such as Save New Account, Update\nProduct, Show Post) by manipulating the model and directing data to the view.\n\nIn Rails, the model is handled by what's called an object-relational mapping\nlayer entitled Active Record. This layer allows you to present the data from\ndatabase rows as objects and embellish these data objects with business logic\nmethods. You can read more about Active Record in\nlink:files/vendor/rails/activerecord/README.html.\n\nThe controller and view are handled by the Action Pack, which handles both\nlayers by its two parts: Action View and Action Controller. These two layers\nare bundled in a single package due to their heavy interdependence. This is\nunlike the relationship between the Active Record and Action Pack that is much\nmore separate. Each of these packages can be used independently outside of\nRails.  You can read more about Action Pack in\nlink:files/vendor/rails/actionpack/README.html.\n\n\n== Getting Started\n\n1. At the command prompt, start a new Rails application using the <tt>rails</tt> command\n   and your application name. Ex: rails myapp\n   (If you've downloaded Rails in a complete tgz or zip, this step is already done)\n2. Change directory into myapp and start the web server: <tt>script/server</tt> (run with --help for options)\n3. Go to http://localhost:3000/ and get \"Welcome aboard: You\u2019re riding the Rails!\"\n4. Follow the guidelines to start developing your application\n\n\n== Web Servers\n\nBy default, Rails will try to use Mongrel and lighttpd if they are installed, otherwise\nRails will use WEBrick, the webserver that ships with Ruby. When you run script/server,\nRails will check if Mongrel exists, then lighttpd and finally fall back to WEBrick. This ensures\nthat you can always get up and running quickly.\n\nMongrel is a Ruby-based webserver with a C component (which requires compilation) that is\nsuitable for development and deployment of Rails applications. If you have Ruby Gems installed,\ngetting up and running with mongrel is as easy as: <tt>gem install mongrel</tt>.\nMore info at: http://mongrel.rubyforge.org\n\nIf Mongrel is not installed, Rails will look for lighttpd. It's considerably faster than\nMongrel and WEBrick and also suited for production use, but requires additional\ninstallation and currently only works well on OS X/Unix (Windows users are encouraged\nto start with Mongrel). We recommend version 1.4.11 and higher. You can download it from\nhttp://www.lighttpd.net.\n\nAnd finally, if neither Mongrel or lighttpd are installed, Rails will use the built-in Ruby\nweb server, WEBrick. WEBrick is a small Ruby web server suitable for development, but not\nfor production.\n\nBut of course its also possible to run Rails on any platform that supports FCGI.\nApache, LiteSpeed, IIS are just a few. For more information on FCGI,\nplease visit: http://wiki.rubyonrails.com/rails/pages/FastCGI\n\n\n== Debugging Rails\n\nSometimes your application goes wrong.  Fortunately there are a lot of tools that\nwill help you debug it and get it back on the rails.\n\nFirst area to check is the application log files.  Have \"tail -f\" commands running\non the server.log and development.log. Rails will automatically display debugging\nand runtime information to these files. Debugging info will also be shown in the\nbrowser on requests from 127.0.0.1.\n\nYou can also log your own messages directly into the log file from your code using\nthe Ruby logger class from inside your controllers. Example:\n\n  class WeblogController < ActionController::Base\n    def destroy\n      @weblog = Weblog.find(params[:id])\n      @weblog.destroy\n      logger.info(\"#{Time.now} Destroyed Weblog ID ##{@weblog.id}!\")\n    end\n  end\n\nThe result will be a message in your log file along the lines of:\n\n  Mon Oct 08 14:22:29 +1000 2007 Destroyed Weblog ID #1\n\nMore information on how to use the logger is at http://www.ruby-doc.org/core/\n\nAlso, Ruby documentation can be found at http://www.ruby-lang.org/ including:\n\n* The Learning Ruby (Pickaxe) Book: http://www.ruby-doc.org/docs/ProgrammingRuby/\n* Learn to Program: http://pine.fm/LearnToProgram/  (a beginners guide)\n\nThese two online (and free) books will bring you up to speed on the Ruby language\nand also on programming in general.\n\n\n== Debugger\n\nDebugger support is available through the debugger command when you start your Mongrel or\nWebrick server with --debugger. This means that you can break out of execution at any point\nin the code, investigate and change the model, AND then resume execution! Example:\n\n  class WeblogController < ActionController::Base\n    def index\n      @posts = Post.find(:all)\n      debugger\n    end\n  end\n\nSo the controller will accept the action, run the first line, then present you\nwith a IRB prompt in the server window. Here you can do things like:\n\n  >> @posts.inspect\n  => \"[#<Post:0x14a6be8 @attributes={\\\"title\\\"=>nil, \\\"body\\\"=>nil, \\\"id\\\"=>\\\"1\\\"}>,\n       #<Post:0x14a6620 @attributes={\\\"title\\\"=>\\\"Rails you know!\\\", \\\"body\\\"=>\\\"Only ten..\\\", \\\"id\\\"=>\\\"2\\\"}>]\"\n  >> @posts.first.title = \"hello from a debugger\"\n  => \"hello from a debugger\"\n\n...and even better is that you can examine how your runtime objects actually work:\n\n  >> f = @posts.first\n  => #<Post:0x13630c4 @attributes={\"title\"=>nil, \"body\"=>nil, \"id\"=>\"1\"}>\n  >> f.\n  Display all 152 possibilities? (y or n)\n\nFinally, when you're ready to resume execution, you enter \"cont\"\n\n\n== Console\n\nYou can interact with the domain model by starting the console through <tt>script/console</tt>.\nHere you'll have all parts of the application configured, just like it is when the\napplication is running. You can inspect domain models, change values, and save to the\ndatabase. Starting the script without arguments will launch it in the development environment.\nPassing an argument will specify a different environment, like <tt>script/console production</tt>.\n\nTo reload your controllers and models after launching the console run <tt>reload!</tt>\n\n\n== Description of Contents\n\napp\n  Holds all the code that's specific to this particular application.\n\napp/controllers\n  Holds controllers that should be named like weblogs_controller.rb for\n  automated URL mapping. All controllers should descend from ApplicationController\n  which itself descends from ActionController::Base.\n\napp/models\n  Holds models that should be named like post.rb.\n  Most models will descend from ActiveRecord::Base.\n\napp/views\n  Holds the template files for the view that should be named like\n  weblogs/index.erb for the WeblogsController#index action.

    "Name": "attachmerb_fu",
    "Readme": "attachmerb-fu\n=====================\n\nattachmerb_fu is a port of Rick Olson's famous attachment_fu Rails plugin to merb. It tries to be as orm-agnostic as merb while having the same functionalities as the original plugin.\n\nThis plugin is still in a very alpha state and was only tested with Datamapper ORM, mini_magick image processor and filesystem storage. It may or may not work for your application\n\n** This fork has been modified to work with ActiveRecord 2.1+ but not Datamapper\n\nNote: attachmerb_fu requires Merb >= 0.9.3\n\nTo use this:\n\nUnpack into lib/attachmerb_fu\n\nThen add to your config/init.rb:\n\nMerb::BootLoader.after_app_loads do\n  require Merb.root / 'lib/attachmerb_fu/datamapper-bindings'\nend\n\nor\n\nMerb::BootLoader.after_app_loads do\n   require Merb.root / 'lib/attachmerb_fu/activerecord_bindings' \nend\n\n\nIn the future, this should be automatically detected.\n\nattachmerb_fu functionality\n===========================\n\nattachmerb_fu facilitates file uploads in Merb.  There are a few storage options for the actual file data, but the plugin always at a minimum stores metadata for each file in the database.\n\nThere are three storage options for files uploaded through attachmerb_fu:\n  File system\n  Database file (currently not tested)\n  Amazon S3 (currently not tested)\n\nEach method of storage many options associated with it that will be covered in the following section.  Something to note, however, is that the Amazon S3 storage requires you to modify config/amazon_s3.yml and the Database file storage requires an extra table.\n\n\nattachmerb_fu models\n====================\n\nFor all three of these storage options a table of metadata is required.  This table will contain information about the file (hence the 'meta') and its location.  This table has no restrictions on naming, unlike the extra table required for database storage, which must have a table name of db_files (and by convention a model of DbFile).\n\nIn the model there are two methods made available by this plugins: has_attachment and validates_as_attachment.\n\nhas_attachment(options = {})\n  This method accepts the options in a hash:\n    :content_type     # Allowed content types.\n                      # Allows all by default.  Use :image to allow all standard image types.\n    :min_size         # Minimum size allowed.\n                      # 1 byte is the default.\n    :max_size         # Maximum size allowed.\n                      # 1.megabyte is the default.\n    :size             # Range of sizes allowed.\n                      # (1..1.megabyte) is the default.  This overrides the :min_size and :max_size options.\n    :resize_to        # Used by RMagick to resize images.\n                      # Pass either an array of width/height, or a geometry string.\n    :thumbnails       # Specifies a set of thumbnails to generate.\n                      # This accepts a hash of filename suffixes and RMagick resizing options.\n                      # This option need only be included if you want thumbnailing.\n    :thumbnail_class  # Set which model class to use for thumbnails.\n                      # This current attachment class is used by default.\n    :path_prefix      # path to store the uploaded files.\n                      # Uses public/#{table_name} by default for the filesystem, and just #{table_name} for the S3 backend.  \n                      # Setting this sets the :storage to :file_system.\n    :storage          # Specifies the storage system to use..\n                      # Defaults to :db_file.  Options are :file_system, :db_file, and :s3.\n    :processor        # Sets the image processor to use for resizing of the attached image.\n                      # Options include ImageScience, Rmagick, and MiniMagick.  Default is whatever is installed.\n\n\n  Examples:\n    has_attachment :max_size => 1.kilobyte\n    has_attachment :size => 1.megabyte..2.megabytes\n    has_attachment :content_type => 'application/pdf'\n    has_attachment :content_type => ['application/pdf', 'application/msword', 'text/plain']\n    has_attachment :content_type => :image, :resize_to => [50,50]\n    has_attachment :content_type => ['application/pdf', :image], :resize_to => 'x50'\n    has_attachment :thumbnails => { :thumb => [50, 50], :geometry => 'x50' }\n    has_attachment :storage => :file_system, :path_prefix => 'public/files'\n    has_attachment :storage => :file_system, :path_prefix => 'public/files', \n                   :content_type => :image, :resize_to => [50,50]\n    has_attachment :storage => :file_system, :path_prefix => 'public/files',\n                   :thumbnails => { :thumb => [50, 50], :geometry => 'x50' }\n    has_attachment :storage => :s3\n\nvalidates_as_attachment\n  This method prevents files outside of the valid range (:min_size to :max_size, or the :size range) from being saved.  It does not however, halt the upload of such files.  They will be uploaded into memory regardless of size before validation.\n\n  Example:\n    validates_as_attachment\n\n\nattachmerb_fu migrations\n========================\n\nFields for attachmerb_fu metadata tables...\n  in general:\n    size,         :integer  # file size in bytes\n    content_type, :string   # mime type, ex: application/mp3\n    filename,     :string   # sanitized filename\n  that reference images:\n    height,       :integer  # in pixels\n    width,        :integer  # in pixels\n  that reference images that will be thumbnailed:\n    parent_id,    :integer  # id of parent image (on the same table, a self-referencing foreign-key).\n                            # Only populated if the current object is a thumbnail.\n    thumbnail,    :string   # the 'type' of thumbnail this attachment record describes.  \n                            # Only populated if the current object is a thumbnail.\n                            # Usage:\n                            # [ In Model 'Avatar' ]\n                            #   has_attachment :content_type => :image, \n                            #                  :storage => :file_system, \n                            #                  :max_size => 500.kilobytes,\n                            #                  :resize_to => '320x200>',\n                            #                  :thumbnails => { :small => '10x10>',\n                            #                                   :thumb => '100x100>' }\n                            # [ Elsewhere ]\n                            # @user.avatar.thumbnails.first.thumbnail #=> 'small'\n  that reference files stored in the database (:db_file):\n    db_file_id,   :integer  # id of the file in the database (foreign key)\n\nField for attachmerb_fu db_files table:\n  data, :binary # binary file data, for use in database file storage\n\n\nattachmerb_fu views\n===================\n\nThere are two main views tasks that will be directly affected by attachmerb_fu: upload forms and displaying uploaded images.\n\nThere are two parts of the upload form that differ from typical usage.\n  1. Include ':multipart => true' in the html options of the form_for tag.\n    Example:\n      <% form_for(:attachment_metadata, :url => { :action => \"create\" }, :html => { :multipart => true }) do |form| %>\n\n  2. Use the file_field helper with :uploaded_data as the field name.\n    Example:\n      <%= form.file_field :uploaded_data %>\n\nDisplaying uploaded images is made easy by the public_filename method of the ActiveRecord attachment objects using file system and s3 storage.\n\npublic_filename(thumbnail = nil)\n  Returns the public path to the file.  If a thumbnail prefix is specified it will return the public file path to the corresponding thumbnail.\n  Examples:\n    attachment_obj.public_filename          #=> /attachments/2/file.jpg\n    attachment_obj.public_filename(:thumb)  #=> /attachments/2/file_thumb.jpg\n    attachment_obj.public_filename(:small)  #=> /attachments/2/file_small.jpg\n\nWhen serving files from database storage, doing more than simply downloading the file is beyond the scope of this document.\n\n\nattachmerb_fu controllers\n=========================\n\nThere are two considerations to take into account when using attachmerb_fu in controllers.\n\nThe first is when the files have no publicly accessible path and need to be downloaded through an action.\n\nExample:\n  def readme\n    send_file '/path/to/readme.txt', :type => 'plain/text', :disposition => 'inline'\n  end\n\nSee the possible values for send_file for reference.\n\n\nThe second is when saving the file when submitted from a form.\nExample in view:\n <%= form.file_field :attachable, :uploaded_data %>\n\nExample in controller:\n  def create\n    @attachable_file = AttachmentMetadataModel.new(params[:attachable])\n    if @attachable_file.save\n      flash[:notice] = 'Attachment was successfully created.'\n      redirect_to attachable_url(@attachable_file)     \n    else\n      render :action => :new\n    end\n  end\n\n",

Gem versions prior to 2.0 support Rails 2.\nWhat makes this so awesome?\nThis is a new implementation of nested set based off of BetterNestedSet that fixes some bugs, removes tons of duplication, adds a few useful methods, and adds STI support.\nInstallation\nAdd to your Gemfile:\ngem 'awesome_nested_set'\nUsage\nTo make use of awesome_nested_set your model needs to have 3 fields:\nlft, rgt, and parent_id. The names of these fields are configurable.\nYou can also have optional fields: depth and children_count. These fields are configurable.\nNote that the children_count column must have null: false and default: 0 to\nfunction properly.\nclass CreateCategories < ActiveRecord::Migration\n  def self.up\n    create_table :categories do |t|\n      t.string :name\n      t.integer :parent_id, :null => true, :index => true\n      t.integer :lft, :null => false, :index => true\n      t.integer :rgt, :null => false, :index => true\n\n      # optional fields\n      t.integer :depth, :null => false, :default => 0\n      t.integer :children_count, :null => false, :default => 0\n    end\n  end\n\n  def self.down\n    drop_table :categories\n  end\nend\nEnable the nested set functionality by declaring acts_as_nested_set on your model\nclass Category < ActiveRecord::Base\n  acts_as_nested_set\nend\nRun rake rdoc to generate the API docs and see CollectiveIdea::Acts::NestedSet for more information.\nOptions\nYou can pass various options to acts_as_nested_set macro. Configuration options are:\n\nparent_column: specifies the column name to use for keeping the position integer (default: parent_id)\nleft_column: column name for left boundary data (default: lft)\nright_column: column name for right boundary data (default: rgt)\ndepth_column: column name for the depth data default (default: depth)\nscope: restricts what is to be considered a list. Given a symbol, it'll attach _id (if it hasn't been already) and use that as the foreign key restriction. You can also pass an array to scope by multiple attributes. Example: acts_as_nested_set :scope => [:notable_id, :notable_type]\ndependent: behavior for cascading destroy. If set to :destroy, all the child objects are destroyed alongside this object by calling their destroy method. If set to :delete_all (default), all the child objects are deleted without calling their destroy method. If set to :nullify, all child objects will become orphaned and become roots themselves.\ncounter_cache: adds a counter cache for the number of children. defaults to false. Example: acts_as_nested_set :counter_cache => :children_count\norder_column: on which column to do sorting, by default it is the left_column_name. Example: acts_as_nested_set :order_column => :position\ntouch: If set to true, then the updated_at timestamp on the ancestors will be set to the current time whenever this object is saved or destroyed (default: false)\n\nSee CollectiveIdea::Acts::NestedSet::Model::ClassMethods for a list of class methods and CollectiveIdea::Acts::NestedSet::Model for a list of instance methods added to acts_as_nested_set models\nIndexes\nIt is highly recommended that you add an index to the rgt column on your models. Every insertion requires finding the next rgt value to use and this can be slow for large tables without an index. It is probably best to index the other fields as well (parent_id, lft, depth).\nCallbacks\nThere are three callbacks called when moving a node:\nbefore_move, after_move and around_move.\nclass Category < ActiveRecord::Base\n  acts_as_nested_set\n\n  after_move :rebuild_slug\n  around_move :da_fancy_things_around\n\n  private\n\n  def rebuild_slug\n    # do whatever\n  end\n\n  def da_fancy_things_around\n    # do something...\n    yield # actually moves\n    # do something else...\n  end\nend\nBeside this there are also hooks to act on the newly added or removed children.\nclass Category < ActiveRecord::Base\n  acts_as_nested_set  :before_add     => :do_before_add_stuff,\n                      :after_add      => :do_after_add_stuff,\n                      :before_remove  => :do_before_remove_stuff,\n                      :after_remove   => :do_after_remove_stuff\n\n  private\n\n  def do_before_add_stuff(child_node)\n    # do whatever with the child\n  end\n\n  def do_after_add_stuff(child_node)\n    # do whatever with the child\n  end\n\n  def do_before_remove_stuff(child_node)\n    # do whatever with the child\n  end\n\n  def do_after_remove_stuff(child_node)\n    # do whatever with the child\n  end\nend\nProtecting attributes from mass assignment\nIt's generally best to \"whitelist\" the attributes that can be used in mass assignment:\nclass Category < ActiveRecord::Base\n  acts_as_nested_set\n  attr_accessible :name, :parent_id\nend\nIf for some reason that is not possible, you will probably want to protect the lft and rgt attributes:\nclass Category < ActiveRecord::Base\n  acts_as_nested_set\n  attr_protected :lft, :rgt\nend\nAdd to your existing project\nTo make use of awesome_nested_set, your model needs to have 3 fields:\nlft, rgt, and parent_id. The names of these fields are configurable.\nYou can also have optional fields, depth and children_count.\nCreate a migration to add fields:\nclass AddNestedToCategories < ActiveRecord::Migration\n\n  def self.up\n    add_column :categories, :parent_id, :integer # Comment this line if your project already has this column\n    # Category.where(parent_id: 0).update_all(parent_id: nil) # Uncomment this line if your project already has :parent_id\n    add_column :categories, :lft,       :integer\n    add_column :categories, :rgt,       :integer\n\n    # optional fields\n    add_column :categories, :depth,          :integer\n    add_column :categories, :children_count, :integer\n\n    # This is necessary to update :lft and :rgt columns\n    Category.rebuild!\n  end\n\n  def self.down\n    remove_column :categories, :parent_id\n    remove_column :categories, :lft\n    remove_column :categories, :rgt\n\n    # optional fields\n    remove_column :categories, :depth\n    remove_column :categories, :children_count\n  end\n\nend\nEnable the nested set functionality by declaring acts_as_nested_set on your model\nclass Category < ActiveRecord::Base\n  acts_as_nested_set\nend\nYour project is now ready to run with the awesome_nested_set gem!\nConversion from other trees\nComing from acts_as_tree or another system where you only have a parent_id? No problem. Simply add the lft & rgt fields as above, and then run:\nCategory.rebuild!\nYour tree will be converted to a valid nested set. Awesome!\nNote: You can use Category.rebuild!(false) to skip model validations when performing the rebuild.\nView Helper\nThe view helper is called #nested_set_options.\nExample usage:\n<%= f.select :parent_id, nested_set_options(Category, @category) {|i| \"#{'-' * i.level} #{i.name}\" } %>\n\n<%= select_tag 'parent_id', options_for_select(nested_set_options(Category) {|i| \"#{'-' * i.level} #{i.name}\" } ) %>\nSee CollectiveIdea::Acts::NestedSet::Helper for more information about the helpers.\nReferences\nYou can learn more about nested sets at: http://threebit.net/tutorials/nestedset/tutorial1.html\nHow to contribute\nPlease see the 'Contributing' document.\nCopyright \u00a9 2008\u20132015 Collective Idea, released under the MIT license.\n",

    "Readme": "The \"embedded actions\" plugin \n=============================\n\nBASIC USAGE\n  Just like the traditional render :partial, embedded actions allow you to\n  refactor your views and extract presentation logic and templates into separate\n  files.\n\n  Unlike partials, embedded actions also let you define business logic to be\n  performed before the partial is included. That logic is encapsulated in the\n  already well understood metaphor of an action inside a controller.\n\n  So a simple call like\n\n  <%= embed_action :controller => \"songs\", :action => \"top10\" %>\n\n  lets you include an html fragment containing the top 10 songs into any of your\n  pages, regardless of which controller, action or view wants to do the including.\n\nCACHING\n  Embedded actions can provide caching of their results (allowing for different \n  parameters) just like page caching, but at the level of html fragments. \n  So your dynamic pages can still be rendered dynamically, but some of the embedded\n  actions can be cached (and expired) independently.\n\n  Just declare an action as 'cacheable' in a way similar to page caching, \n  by invoking \"caches_embedded\" with the name of the action to cache.\n\n  class TestController < ApplicationController\n    caches_embedded :user_list\n\n    def user_list\n      ...\n    end\n  end\n\n  Cached fragments can be invalidated with calls to expires_embedded, but you must\n  remember to use the same set of parameters used to embed the cached action in\n  the first place.\n\n  Additionally, the underlying fragment caching mechanism can be passed \n  an options hash in the following manner:\n\n    caches_embedded :user_list, :ttl => 60.minutes\n\n  And you can specify additional arguments to be used when generating the cache name.\n  Which is better explained with an example:\n\n    caches_embedded :user_list, :options_for_name => Proc.new do |controller| \n      {:is_admin => controller.current_user.is_admin?}\n    end\n\n  this way, there will be two separate cached versions, one for admin users and one \n  for regular users. The hash returned is merged with the actual hash passed on\n  the embed_action call, and is used to create an \"url-like\" name for the cached\n  fragment. So in this case, a call like <%= embed_action :action => \"test\" %> will\n  produce two different fragments: \"/mycontroller/test?is_admin=false\" and \"...?is_admin=true\"\n  depending on the result of controller.current_user.is_admin? when embed_action \n  is called.\n\n  Finally, cached fragments can be compressed before being stored:\n\n    caches_embedded :user_list, :compress => true\n\n\nRESPONDS_TO\n  Actions can use Rails' responds_to to provide different behaviours when invoked \n  normally or embedded in another view.\n\n  class TestController < ApplicationController\n    def user_list\n      responds_to do |format|\n        format.html     {render :layout => :application}\n        format.embedded {render :layout => false}\n      end\n    end\n  end\n\nSOURCE CODE\n  The official repository for embedded_actions is in GitHub:\n\n  http://github.com/sd/embedded-actions/tree/master\n\n\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nCopyright (c) 2007, 2008 Sebastian Delmont <sd@notso.net> \nCopyright (c) 2007, 2008 StreetEasy / NMD Interactive <http://www.streeteasy.com/> \nAll rights reserved.\n\nRedistribution and use in source and binary forms, with or without modification,\nare permitted provided that the following conditions are met:\n\n* Redistributions of source code must retain the above copyright notice, this \nlist of conditions and the following disclaimer.\n\n* Redistributions in binary form must reproduce the above copyright notice, this\nlist of conditions and the following disclaimer in the documentation and/or\nother materials provided with the distribution.\n\n* Neither the name of Sebastian Delmont, nor StreetEasy nor NMD Interactive \nnor the names of their contributors may be used to endorse or promote products \nderived from this software without specific prior written permission.\n\nTHIS SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED BY THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND CONTRIBUTORS \"AS IS\" AND\nANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED\nWARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE ARE\nDISCLAIMED.

    "Readme": "ABOUT\nIo is a dynamic prototype-based programming language. \nThe programming guide and reference manual can be found in the docs folder.\nREQUIREMENTS\n\nyajl\nlibevent\npcre\npython v.3.3.0+\n\nINSTALLING\nIo is two parts - the vm and the addons/packages. Don't worry if all the addons don't compile for you - some are platform specific or not well supported.\nThere are a couple ways you can go about building Io, I will give the recommended way, and a note about how to do it alternatively.\nNOTE: If you are installing in a production environment, use cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=release .. in all the cmake .. lines below. This tells CMake to compile with standard optimizations. Without the -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=release addition the resulting binaries will have been compiled in debug mode with no standard C optimizations applied.\nOSX\nIf you are using the homebrew package manager you can install Io (though it may not be the latest version) with:\nbrew install io\n\nNote: Assuming you wish to install to an alternate location, ensure you supply as an argument to the following command, a -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/path where /path is where you wish to install Io to. This is akin to setting INSTALL_PREFIX with the old build system if you are familiar with it, or --prefix with GNU autotools if you are familiar with that suite.\nEnsure you are at the top level of the source tree, that is where this file lives. From here, you are in the right spot to enter these commands:\nmkdir build\ncd build\ncmake ..\nmake install\n\nIf you do not wish to install, just run make instead of make install. Currently there is no analogue to the old make linkInstall. However, if you have used linkInstall in previous versions of Io, you should never have to run linkInstall again, since it created symbolic links to where your Io source was at that time. The only time you would have to do this again, is if you moved the Io source from one dir to another. Most people don't.\nAny Linux Distribution\nAny Linux distribution will require one additional step be taken. This is because GNU ld is what's technically known as a \"dumb\" linker -- it has to be told to regenerate its hash of libraries if something changes, other platforms do not have this problem. To complete this step, run the following command:\nldconfig\n\nIf you are still getting an error when loading the io binary about not being able to find some shared library, then ensure you have the following path, in your /etc/ld.so.conf (or equivalent):\n/usr/local/lib\n\nThe above path will change depending on what you set your CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX to, it will be whatever that is with /lib appended. The default is /usr/local so the above will work for the common case.\nDebian or Ubuntu\nSee OSX instructions.\nGentoo\nSee OSX instructions.\nMS WINDOWS\nFor all the different methods explained here, some of the addons won't compile as they depend on libraries not provided by Io.\nFor methods A and B you must download and install CMake (at least v2.8) from here: http://www.cmake.org/cmake/resources/software.html\nFor method C you must install the CMake Cygwin package (at least v2.8) using the Cygwin package installer.\nFor the make install command, if you are on Windows 7/Vista you will need to run your command prompts as Administrator: right-click on the command prompt launcher->\"Run as administrator\" or something similar)\nYou will also need to add <install_drive>:\\<install_directory>\\bin and <install_drive>:\\<install_directory>\\lib to your PATH environment variable.\nA) Building with MSVC\n\nInstall Microsoft Visual C++ 2008 Express (should work with other versions).\nInstall Microsoft Windows SDK 7.0 (or newer).\nInstall CMake (v2.8 at least)\nRun \"Vistual Studio 2008 Command Prompt\" from the \"Microsoft Visual Studio 2008\" start menu.\ncd to <install_drive>:\\Microsoft SDKs\\Windows\\v7.0\\Setup then run: WindowsSdkVer.exe -version:v7.0\nClose the command prompt window and run step 4 again\nEnsure CMake bin path is in the PATH environment variable (eg: echo %PATH% and see that the folder is there) if not you will have to add it to your PATH.\ncd to your Io root folder\nWe want to do an out-of-source build, so: mkdir buildroot and cd buildroot\na) cmake ..\nor\nb) cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=<install_drive>:\\<install_directory> .. (eg: cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=C:\\Io ..)\nnmake\nnmake install\n\nB) Building with MinGW\nFor automatic MinGW install: http://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw/files/Automated%20MinGW%20Installer\nFor non-automatic MinGW install and detailed instructions refer to: http://www.mingw.org/wiki/InstallationHOWTOforMinGW\n\ncd to your Io root folder\nWe want to do an out-of-source build, so: mkdir buildroot and cd buildroot\na) cmake -G\"MSYS Makefiles\" ..\nor\nb) cmake -G\"MSYS Makefiles\" -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=<install_drive>:/<install_directory> ..

Install with:\n\n  sudo port install ffmpeg\n\nOr, for a better build (recommended), add additional video- and audio-related\nlibraries, like this:\n\n  sudo port install ffmpeg +lame +libogg +vorbis +faac +faad +xvid +x264 +a52\n\nMost package management systems include a build of ffmpeg, but many include a\npoor build. So you may need to compile from scratch.\n\nIf you want to create Flash Video files, also install flvtool2:\n\n  sudo gem install flvtool2\n\nOnce ffmpeg and RVideo are installed, you're set. \n\nTo inspect a file, initialize an RVideo file inspector object. See the \ndocumentation for details.\n\nA few examples:\n\n  file = RVideo::Inspector.new(:file => \"#{APP_ROOT}/files/input.mp4\")\n\n  file = RVideo::Inspector.new(:raw_response => @existing_response)\n\n  file = RVideo::Inspector.new(:file => \"#{APP_ROOT}/files/input.mp4\",\n                                :ffmpeg_binary => \"#{APP_ROOT}/bin/ffmpeg\")\n\n  file.fps        # \"29.97\"\n  file.duration   # \"00:05:23.4\"\n\nTo transcode a video, initialize a Transcoder object.\n\n  transcoder = RVideo::Transcoder.new\n\nThen pass a command and valid options to the execute method\n\n  recipe = \"ffmpeg -i $input_file$ -ar 22050 -ab 64 -f flv -r 29.97 -s\"\n  recipe += \" $resolution$ -y $output_file$\"\n  recipe += \"\\nflvtool2 -U $output_file$\"\n  begin\n    transcoder.execute(recipe, {:input_file => \"/path/to/input.mp4\",\n      :output_file => \"/path/to/output.flv\", :resolution => \"640x360\"})\n  rescue TranscoderError => e\n    puts \"Unable to transcode file: #{e.class} - #{e.message}\"\n  end\n\nIf the job succeeds, you can access the metadata of the input and output\nfiles with:\n\n  transcoder.original     # RVideo::Inspector object\n  transcoder.processed    # RVideo::Inspector object\n\nIf the transcoding succeeds, the file may still have problems. RVideo\nwill populate an errors array if the duration of the processed video\ndiffers from the duration of the original video, or if the processed\nfile is unreadable.\n\nThanks to Peter Boling for early work on RVideo.\n\nContribute to RVideo! If you want to help out, there are a few things you can \ndo.\n\n- Use, test, and submit bugs/patches\n- We need a RVideo::Tools::Mencoder class to add mencoder support.\n- Other tool classes would be great - On2, mp4box, Quicktime (?), etc.\n- Submit other fixes, features, optimizations, and refactorings\n\nIf RVideo is useful to you, you may also be interested in RMovie, another Ruby\nvideo library. See http://rmovie.rubyforge.org/ for more.\n\nFinally, watch for Spinoza, a commercial video transcoder built by Slantwise \nDesign. Spinoza uses RVideo for its video processing, but adds file queuing,  \ndistributed transcoding, a web-based transcoder dashboard, and more. See \nhttp://spinoza.tv or http://slantwisedesign.com for more.\n\nCopyright (c) 2007 Jonathan Dahl and Slantwise Design. Released under the MIT \nlicense.\n",

    "Readme": "== Welcome to Rails\n\nRails is a web-application and persistence framework that includes everything\nneeded to create database-backed web-applications according to the\nModel-View-Control pattern of separation. This pattern splits the view (also\ncalled the presentation) into \"dumb\" templates that are primarily responsible\nfor inserting pre-built data in between HTML tags. The model contains the\n\"smart\" domain objects (such as Account, Product, Person, Post) that holds all\nthe business logic and knows how to persist themselves to a database. The\ncontroller handles the incoming requests (such as Save New Account, Update\nProduct, Show Post) by manipulating the model and directing data to the view.\n\nIn Rails, the model is handled by what's called an object-relational mapping\nlayer entitled Active Record. This layer allows you to present the data from\ndatabase rows as objects and embellish these data objects with business logic\nmethods. You can read more about Active Record in\nlink:files/vendor/rails/activerecord/README.html.\n\nThe controller and view are handled by the Action Pack, which handles both\nlayers by its two parts: Action View and Action Controller. These two layers\nare bundled in a single package due to their heavy interdependence. This is\nunlike the relationship between the Active Record and Action Pack that is much\nmore separate. Each of these packages can be used independently outside of\nRails.  You can read more about Action Pack in\nlink:files/vendor/rails/actionpack/README.html.\n\n\n== Getting Started\n\n1. At the command prompt, start a new Rails application using the <tt>rails</tt> command\n   and your application name. Ex: rails myapp\n   (If you've downloaded Rails in a complete tgz or zip, this step is already done)\n2. Change directory into myapp and start the web server: <tt>script/server</tt> (run with --help for options)\n3. Go to http://localhost:3000/ and get \"Welcome aboard: You\u2019re riding the Rails!\"\n4. Follow the guidelines to start developing your application\n\n\n== Web Servers\n\nBy default, Rails will try to use Mongrel and lighttpd if they are installed, otherwise\nRails will use WEBrick, the webserver that ships with Ruby. When you run script/server,\nRails will check if Mongrel exists, then lighttpd and finally fall back to WEBrick. This ensures\nthat you can always get up and running quickly.\n\nMongrel is a Ruby-based webserver with a C component (which requires compilation) that is\nsuitable for development and deployment of Rails applications. If you have Ruby Gems installed,\ngetting up and running with mongrel is as easy as: <tt>gem install mongrel</tt>.\nMore info at: http://mongrel.rubyforge.org\n\nIf Mongrel is not installed, Rails will look for lighttpd. It's considerably faster than\nMongrel and WEBrick and also suited for production use, but requires additional\ninstallation and currently only works well on OS X/Unix (Windows users are encouraged\nto start with Mongrel). We recommend version 1.4.11 and higher. You can download it from\nhttp://www.lighttpd.net.\n\nAnd finally, if neither Mongrel or lighttpd are installed, Rails will use the built-in Ruby\nweb server, WEBrick. WEBrick is a small Ruby web server suitable for development, but not\nfor production.\n\nBut of course its also possible to run Rails on any platform that supports FCGI.\nApache, LiteSpeed, IIS are just a few. For more information on FCGI,\nplease visit: http://wiki.rubyonrails.com/rails/pages/FastCGI\n\n\n== Debugging Rails\n\nSometimes your application goes wrong.  Fortunately there are a lot of tools that\nwill help you debug it and get it back on the rails.\n\nFirst area to check is the application log files.  Have \"tail -f\" commands running\non the server.log and development.log. Rails will automatically display debugging\nand runtime information to these files. Debugging info will also be shown in the\nbrowser on requests from 127.0.0.1.\n\nYou can also log your own messages directly into the log file from your code using\nthe Ruby logger class from inside your controllers. Example:\n\n  class WeblogController < ActionController::Base\n    def destroy\n      @weblog = Weblog.find(params[:id])\n      @weblog.destroy\n      logger.info(\"#{Time.now} Destroyed Weblog ID ##{@weblog.id}!\")\n    end\n  end\n\nThe result will be a message in your log file along the lines of:\n\n  Mon Oct 08 14:22:29 +1000 2007 Destroyed Weblog ID #1\n\nMore information on how to use the logger is at http://www.ruby-doc.org/core/\n\nAlso, Ruby documentation can be found at http://www.ruby-lang.org/ including:\n\n* The Learning Ruby (Pickaxe) Book: http://www.ruby-doc.org/docs/ProgrammingRuby/\n* Learn to Program: http://pine.fm/LearnToProgram/  (a beginners guide)\n\nThese two online (and free) books will bring you up to speed on the Ruby language\nand also on programming in general.\n\n\n== Debugger\n\nDebugger support is available through the debugger command when you start your Mongrel or\nWebrick server with --debugger. This means that you can break out of execution at any point\nin the code, investigate and change the model, AND then resume execution! Example:\n\n  class WeblogController < ActionController::Base\n    def index\n      @posts = Post.find(:all)\n      debugger\n    end\n  end\n\nSo the controller will accept the action, run the first line, then present you\nwith a IRB prompt in the server window. Here you can do things like:\n\n  >> @posts.inspect\n  => \"[#<Post:0x14a6be8 @attributes={\\\"title\\\"=>nil, \\\"body\\\"=>nil, \\\"id\\\"=>\\\"1\\\"}>,\n       #<Post:0x14a6620 @attributes={\\\"title\\\"=>\\\"Rails you know!\\\", \\\"body\\\"=>\\\"Only ten..\\\", \\\"id\\\"=>\\\"2\\\"}>]\"\n  >> @posts.first.title = \"hello from a debugger\"\n  => \"hello from a debugger\"\n\n...and even better is that you can examine how your runtime objects actually work:\n\n  >> f = @posts.first\n  => #<Post:0x13630c4 @attributes={\"title\"=>nil, \"body\"=>nil, \"id\"=>\"1\"}>\n  >> f.\n  Display all 152 possibilities? (y or n)\n\nFinally, when you're ready to resume execution, you enter \"cont\"\n\n\n== Console\n\nYou can interact with the domain model by starting the console through <tt>script/console</tt>.\nHere you'll have all parts of the application configured, just like it is when the\napplication is running. You can inspect domain models, change values, and save to the\ndatabase. Starting the script without arguments will launch it in the development environment.\nPassing an argument will specify a different environment, like <tt>script/console production</tt>.\n\nTo reload your controllers and models after launching the console run <tt>reload!</tt>\n\n\n== Description of Contents\n\napp\n  Holds all the code that's specific to this particular application.\n\napp/controllers\n  Holds controllers that should be named like weblogs_controller.rb for\n  automated URL mapping. All controllers should descend from ApplicationController\n  which itself descends from ActionController::Base.\n\napp/models\n  Holds models that should be named like post.rb.\n  Most models will descend from ActiveRecord::Base.\n\napp/views\n  Holds the template files for the view that should be named like\n  weblogs/index.erb for the WeblogsController#index action. All views use eRuby\n  syntax.\n\napp/views/layouts\n  Holds the template files for layouts to be used with views. This models the common\n  header/footer method of wrapping views. In your views, define a layout using the\n  <tt>layout :default</tt> and create a file named default.erb. Inside default.erb,\n  call <% yield %> to render the view using this layout.\n\napp/helpers\n  Holds view helpers that should be named like weblogs_helper.rb. These are generated\n  for you automatically when using script/generate for controllers. Helpers can be used to\n  wrap functionality for your views into methods.\n\nconfig\n  Configuration files for the Rails environment, the routing map, the database, and other dependencies.\n\ndb\n  Contains the database schema in schema.rb.  db/migrate contains all\n  the sequence of Migrations for your schema.\n\ndoc\n  This directory is where your application documentation will be stored when generated\n  using <tt>rake doc:app</tt>\n\nlib\n  Application specific libraries. Basically, any kind of custom code that doesn't\n  belong under controllers, models, or helpers. This directory is in the load path.\n\npublic\n  The directory available for the web server. Contains subdirectories for images, stylesheets,\n  and javascripts. Also contains the dispatchers and the default HTML files. This should be\n  set as the DOCUMENT_ROOT of your web server.\n\nscript\n  Helper scripts for automation and generation.\n\ntest\n  Unit and functional tests along with fixtures. When using the script/generate scripts, template\n  test files will be generated for you and placed in this directory.\n\nvendor\n  External libraries that the application depends on. Also includes the plugins subdirectory.\n  This directory is in the load path.\n\n",

    "Name": "fixture-scenarios",
    "Readme": "Copyright (c) 2007 Tom Preston-Werner\n\n=FixtureScenarios\n\nThis plugin allows you to create \"scenarios\" which are collections of fixtures\nand ruby files that represent a context against which you can run tests.\n\n==Disclaimer\n\nThis software is in Beta.\nSend feedback to tom at rubyisawesome dot com or find me (mojombo) on irc.freenode.net.\n\n==Installation\n\nFixtureScenarios should work on both 1.1.6 and edge rails.\nCurrently you must install this plugin from the subversion repository\n\n  script/plugin install http://fixture-scenarios.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/fixture_scenarios\n\n==WARNING\n\nBecause this plugin clears out fixture data between your test classes, you may\nsee some of your tests fail after installation. If this occurs, look at your\ntests to see if you didn't actually load a required fixture for that test\nclass. If you forgot to add it and your tests passed anyway (because of\nfixture contamination), just add the missing fixture(s) and you'll be good\nto go.\n\n==The Basics\n\nTo create a scenario, simply create a subdirectory under test/fixtures in your\nRails app. The name of the subdirectory will be the name of the scenario.\nInside this new directory, you can place fixture files, and/or Ruby files.\n\n  [RAILS_ROOT]\n  +-test/\n    +-fixtures/\n      +-brand_new_user/\n        +-users.yml\n\n  # in users.yml\n  borges:\n    id: 1\n    name: Jorge Luis Borges\n    active: 1\n\nTo load the scenario for testing, you simply use the +scenario+ method instead\nof the normal +fixtures+ method.\n\n  require File.dirname(__FILE__) + '/../test_helper'\n\n  class UserTest < Test::Unit::TestCase\n    scenario :brand_new_user\n\n    def test_should_be_active\n      assert users(:borges).active?\n    end\n  end\n\nAll of the fixtures placed into your scenario directory will be loaded when\nyou invoke the +scenario+ method with your scenario name. In addition, any\nRuby files you place in the scenario directory will be run after the fixtures.\nYou can use a Ruby file to create non-database model instances, set up\nrelationships between fixtures (instead of creating fixtures for the join\ntables), or replace fixtures entirely by creating your database items with\nRuby code.\n\nIn this example, +scenario+ will actually load all fixtures from the fixture\ndirectory *and* your scenario directory. This is useful if you have some\nfixtures (such as lookup data) that you'd like to have in most of your\nscenarios. To prevent the loading of fixtures in the fixtures root directory,\nuse the <tt>:root</tt> option. This can be very useful if you still have tests\nusing regular fixtures.\n\n  scenario :brand_new_user, :root => false\n\nIf you've just started FixtureScenarios on an existing project, adding\n:root => false to every scenario call will become tedious, so you can set\nthe option globally in your test_helper.rb (inside the Test::Unit::TestCase\nclass) like so:\n\n  self.scenarios_load_root_fixtures = false\n\nTo keep things DRY in your scenarios, you can extend or layer scenarios on top\nof each other. Following with our example, to create an \"experienced user\"\nscenario, we could create another subdirectory under the existing\n\"brand_new_user\" that would contain fixture/Ruby files that add upon the\n\"brand new user\" scenario.\n\n  [RAILS_ROOT]\n  +-test/\n    +-fixtures/\n      +-brand_new_user/\n        +-users.yml\n        +-experienced_user/\n          +-articles.yml\n\nNow when you load the +experienced_user+ scenario, it will load any\nfixture/Ruby files in \"fixtures\", then in \"brand_new_user\", then in\n\"experienced_user\"! Building off of your existing scenarios keeps data\nredundancy to a minimum, and makes it easy to change data for multiple\nscenarios simultaneously.\n\n==Testing your scenarios\n\nScenarios represent your assumptions about a given context. If these\nassumptions are wrong, your tests will be inaccurate. Your scenarios should be\nunit tested along with the rest of your application. This plugin allows you to\nplace scenario tests in a \"scenario\" directory under your \"test\" directory.\n\n  [RAILS_ROOT]\n  +-test/\n    +-scenario/\n      +-brand_new_user_test.rb\n      +-experienced_user_test.rb\n\nYou can run these tests with rake.\n\n  rake test:scenarios  # run just scenario tests\n  rake                 # run unit, functional, integration, and scenario tests\n\nScenario tests will protect you from accidentally changing your assumptions in\na dangerous or transparent way when modifying existing scenarios.\n",

    "Name": "date-performance",
    "Readme": "Date::Performance\nThis package adds some semblance of performance to Ruby 1.8's core Date class \nusing a combination of different techniques:\n\nImplements various core Date methods in C. This is nowhere near a\ncomplete rewrite of all Date features but many of the hot spots have\nbeen replaced with machine code.\nProvide alternate implementations of strftime and strptime in C.  The stock\ndate formatting and parsing methods are extremely slow compared to their\nlibc counterparts. Date#sys_strftime and Date::sys_strptime are light\nfacades on top of the system's strftime(2) and strptime(2). The system \nmethods run 10x and 50x (yes, fifty-ecks) faster than their Ruby based counterparts, \nrespectively.  Unfortunately, strftime(2) and strptime(2) implementations vary from\nsystem to system and have various limitations not found in the core Date\nimplementation so can not safely be used as replacements for the core methods.\nMemoization. The Date::Memoize module can be used to speed certain\ntypes of repetitive date processing significantly. This file must be \nrequired separately.\n\nSynopsis\nThis package is mostly transparent after an initial require:\nrequire 'date/performance'\nDate.new 1912, 6, 23\n# Wow! That was fast!\n\nDate::Performance is not used directly but automatically replaces core Date\nmethods when required.\nIn addition to the C extension, the Date::Memoization module can be used to\nspeed things up even further in some cases by making a trade off between space \nand time:\nrequire 'date/memoize'\nDate.new 1912, 6, 23\nDate.parse '1912-06-23'\n\nRequiring the file automatically replaces Date::new / Date::civil, Date::parse, \nand Date::jd methods with memoized versions.\nInstallation / Hacking\nThis package has been tested on the following platforms:\n\nFreeBSD 5.4 (x86) and 6.1 (AMD64)\nLinux / Fedora Core 6 (x86)\nMacOS X (Intel)\n\nThe easiest way to install the package is to use RubyGems:\n$ gem install date-performance\n\nA git repository is also available:\n$ git clone git://github.com/rtomayko/date-performance.git\n\nBackground\nThe Date class is often the cause of poor performance in Ruby programs. A frequent\nsuggestion is to use the Time class, which is much faster, but that solution has \ncorrectness problems in a wide range of data typing cases. It is often the case that \nyou want separate Date, Time, and DateTime types.\nThere are a couple of reasons why Date runs slowly when compared with\nTime. The common assumption is that this is mostly due to Time being\nwritten in C and Date being written in Ruby. While that clearly has an\nimpact, I would argue that the reason Date is slow is because it's not\ndesigned to be fast. The code opts for readability over performance in almost\nevery case. This is a feature.\nHave you read the date.rb documentation [1]? The implementation is pretty\nhard core; it can handle a lot of weird cases that Time [2] does not and\nwould appear to be a correct implementation of date handling, which has the\nusual side-effect of being slow.\nThe Date implementation uses a single Astronomical Julian Day (AJD) number\nto represent dates internally. In fact, Date#initialize takes a\nsingle ajd argument, which means that all date forms that are commonly used \n(UNIX timestamp, Civil, etc.) must be converted to an AJD before we can even\ninstantiate the thing. \nThe real performance hit seems to come from the various rational number\noperations performed on the way from a civil, ordinal, and julian date to \nan AJD.\nWhen I began writing Date::Performance, I was getting pretty big (3x - 4x)\nperformance boosts in many places simply by optimizing the Ruby code a bit.\nThese boosts came at the expense of readability, however, and so the decision\nwas made to go for maximum unreadability and implement the boosts in C.\nThere's a nice balance here: the Ruby implementation reads like a spec,\nwhile the C version implements it for quickness.\nMemoization\nIn addition to the C extension, this package includes a separate Date::Memoize\nmodule that can further speed up date processing in situations where the range\nof dates being manipulated is fairly dense and the same dates are being\ncreated repeatedly. Working with databases and flat files are two examples\nwhere memoization may help significantly.\nThe Date::Memoize module replaces various Date constructor methods (new,\ncivil, and parse) with memoized[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memoization] \nversions (see Date::Memoization for details). The best way to determine \nwhether memoization is right for you is to add it to your project and see \nwhat happens.\nLicense\nMIT.

This ensures\nthat you can always get up and running quickly.\n\nMongrel is a Ruby-based webserver with a C component (which requires compilation) that is\nsuitable for development and deployment of Rails applications. If you have Ruby Gems installed,\ngetting up and running with mongrel is as easy as: <tt>gem install mongrel</tt>.\nMore info at: http://mongrel.rubyforge.org\n\nIf Mongrel is not installed, Rails will look for lighttpd. It's considerably faster than\nMongrel and WEBrick and also suited for production use, but requires additional\ninstallation and currently only works well on OS X/Unix (Windows users are encouraged\nto start with Mongrel). We recommend version 1.4.11 and higher. You can download it from\nhttp://www.lighttpd.net.\n\nAnd finally, if neither Mongrel or lighttpd are installed, Rails will use the built-in Ruby\nweb server, WEBrick. WEBrick is a small Ruby web server suitable for development, but not\nfor production.\n\nBut of course its also possible to run Rails on any platform that supports FCGI.\nApache, LiteSpeed, IIS are just a few. For more information on FCGI,\nplease visit: http://wiki.rubyonrails.com/rails/pages/FastCGI\n\n\n== Debugging Rails\n\nSometimes your application goes wrong.  Fortunately there are a lot of tools that\nwill help you debug it and get it back on the rails.\n\nFirst area to check is the application log files.  Have \"tail -f\" commands running\non the server.log and development.log. Rails will automatically display debugging\nand runtime information to these files. Debugging info will also be shown in the\nbrowser on requests from 127.0.0.1.\n\nYou can also log your own messages directly into the log file from your code using\nthe Ruby logger class from inside your controllers. Example:\n\n  class WeblogController < ActionController::Base\n    def destroy\n      @weblog = Weblog.find(params[:id])\n      @weblog.destroy\n      logger.info(\"#{Time.now} Destroyed Weblog ID ##{@weblog.id}!\")\n    end\n  end\n\nThe result will be a message in your log file along the lines of:\n\n  Mon Oct 08 14:22:29 +1000 2007 Destroyed Weblog ID #1\n\nMore information on how to use the logger is at http://www.ruby-doc.org/core/\n\nAlso, Ruby documentation can be found at http://www.ruby-lang.org/ including:\n\n* The Learning Ruby (Pickaxe) Book: http://www.ruby-doc.org/docs/ProgrammingRuby/\n* Learn to Program: http://pine.fm/LearnToProgram/  (a beginners guide)\n\nThese two online (and free) books will bring you up to speed on the Ruby language\nand also on programming in general.\n\n\n== Debugger\n\nDebugger support is available through the debugger command when you start your Mongrel or\nWebrick server with --debugger. This means that you can break out of execution at any point\nin the code, investigate and change the model, AND then resume execution! Example:\n\n  class WeblogController < ActionController::Base\n    def index\n      @posts = Post.find(:all)\n      debugger\n    end\n  end\n\nSo the controller will accept the action, run the first line, then present you\nwith a IRB prompt in the server window. Here you can do things like:\n\n  >> @posts.inspect\n  => \"[#<Post:0x14a6be8 @attributes={\\\"title\\\"=>nil, \\\"body\\\"=>nil, \\\"id\\\"=>\\\"1\\\"}>,\n       #<Post:0x14a6620 @attributes={\\\"title\\\"=>\\\"Rails you know!\\\", \\\"body\\\"=>\\\"Only ten..\\\", \\\"id\\\"=>\\\"2\\\"}>]\"\n  >> @posts.first.title = \"hello from a debugger\"\n  => \"hello from a debugger\"\n\n...and even better is that you can examine how your runtime objects actually work:\n\n  >> f = @posts.first\n  => #<Post:0x13630c4 @attributes={\"title\"=>nil, \"body\"=>nil, \"id\"=>\"1\"}>\n  >> f.\n  Display all 152 possibilities? (y or n)\n\nFinally, when you're ready to resume execution, you enter \"cont\"\n\n\n== Console\n\nYou can interact with the domain model by starting the console through <tt>script/console</tt>.\nHere you'll have all parts of the application configured, just like it is when the\napplication is running. You can inspect domain models, change values, and save to the\ndatabase. Starting the script without arguments will launch it in the development environment.\nPassing an argument will specify a different environment, like <tt>script/console production</tt>.\n\nTo reload your controllers and models after launching the console run <tt>reload!</tt>\n\n\n== Description of Contents\n\napp\n  Holds all the code that's specific to this particular application.\n\napp/controllers\n  Holds controllers that should be named like weblogs_controller.rb for\n  automated URL mapping. All controllers should descend from ApplicationController\n  which itself descends from ActionController::Base.\n\napp/models\n  Holds models that should be named like post.rb.\n  Most models will descend from ActiveRecord::Base.\n\napp/views\n  Holds the template files for the view that should be named like\n  weblogs/index.erb for the WeblogsController#index action. All views use eRuby\n  syntax.\n\napp/views/layouts\n  Holds the template files for layouts to be used with views. This models the common\n  header/footer method of wrapping views. In your views, define a layout using the\n  <tt>layout :default</tt> and create a file named default.erb. Inside default.erb,\n  call <% yield %> to render the view using this layout.\n\napp/helpers\n  Holds view helpers that should be named like weblogs_helper.rb. These are generated\n  for you automatically when using script/generate for controllers. Helpers can be used to\n  wrap functionality for your views into methods.\n\nconfig\n  Configuration files for the Rails environment, the routing map, the database, and other dependencies.\n\ndb\n  Contains the database schema in schema.rb.  db/migrate contains all\n  the sequence of Migrations for your schema.\n\ndoc\n  This directory is where your application documentation will be stored when generated\n  using <tt>rake doc:app</tt>\n\nlib\n  Application specific libraries. Basically, any kind of custom code that doesn't\n  belong under controllers, models, or helpers. This directory is in the load path.\n\npublic\n  The directory available for the web server. Contains subdirectories for images, stylesheets,\n  and javascripts. Also contains the dispatchers and the default HTML files. This should be\n  set as the DOCUMENT_ROOT of your web server.\n\nscript\n  Helper scripts for automation and generation.\n\ntest\n  Unit and functional tests along with fixtures. When using the script/generate scripts, template\n  test files will be generated for you and placed in this directory.\n\nvendor\n  External libraries that the application depends on. Also includes the plugins subdirectory.\n  This directory is in the load path.\n\n",

    "Readme": "# Effen #\n\n*Effen* is a jQuery plugin that supports Concrete Javascript. Concrete Javascript is a pattern in which the state and behavior of your domain are attached directly to DOM elements. This differs from MVC, where domain behavior is isolated from the view. Concrete Javascript is draws inspiration from Self's Morphic UI framework.\n\n## Use ##\n\nTo attach behaviors (methods) to DOM nodes, pass a hash to the `fn` function:\n\n    $('div').fn({\n      method1: function(...) {...},\n      method2: function(...) {...}\n    })\n\nTo invoke a method, pass a string naming the method and any arguments to the `fn` function:\n\n    $('div').fn('method1', some, arguments, here);\n\nThat's all there is to it. But there are some subtle details to bear in mind:\n\n* While `$('div').fn({...})` will bind the behavior to all divs, calling `$('div').fn('foo')` will only invoke `foo` on the first `div`. This may be changed in future releases.\n\n* Binding is order-dependent. So, for example, to provide specialized behavior:\n\n    $('div').fn({ foo: function() {} });\n    $('div.special').fn({ foo: function() {} });\n\n The latter takes precedence because it appears last--NOT because the selector is more specific. This may be changed in future releases.\n\n## An in-depth example of Concrete Programming ##\n\nSuppose we have the following HTML code, representing a Script that has many Scenes. A Scene has a Video description and many lines of Dialog.\n\n    <div class=\"script\" url=\"/scripts/1\">\n      <ol class=\"scenes\" url=\"/scripts/1/scenes\">\n        <li class=\"scene\" url=\"/scripts/1/scenes/1\">\n          <textarea name=\"video\">Interior of Pivotal Labs, Day.</textarea>\n          <ol class=\"dialogs\" url=\"/scripts/1/scenes/1/dialogs\">\n            <li class=\"dialog\" url=\"/scripts/1/scenes/1/dialogs/1\">\n              <input type=\"text\" name=\"character\" value=\"Nick\" />\n              <input type=\"text\" name=\"text\" value=\"I like Concrete Programming\" />\n            </li>\n            <li class=\"dialog\" url=\"/scripts/1/scenes/1/dialogs/2\">\n              <input type=\"text\" name=\"character\" value=\"Nathan\" />\n              <input type=\"text\" name=\"text\" value=\"Me too\" />\n            </li>\n          </ol>\n        </li>\n      </ol>\n    </div>\n\n### Let's start with some simple CRUD operations. To *create* a scene, we POST to the url: ###\n\n    $('.scenes').fn({\n      create: function() {\n        $.post($(this).attr('url'), ...);\n      }\n    });\n\nWe'd like to also create a scene any time someone hits &lt;Ctrl+Enter&gt; within the video textarea.\n\n    $('.scene textarea.video').bind('keypress[ctrl+enter]', function() {\n      ...\n    });\n\nIn order to invoke the `create` function on the scene containing the textarea, we'll need a reference from the textarea to the scene:\n\n    $('.scene').each(function(i, scene) {\n      $(scene).find('*').fn('scene', $(this));\n    });\n\nNow, binding <Ctrl+Enter> on the textarea to invoke create is as simple as:\n\n    $('.scenes textarea.video').bind('keypress[ctrl+enter]', function() {\n      $(this).fn('scenes').fn('create');\n    });\n\n### Let's perform a Delete now ###\n\nWe'd also like to bind the &lt;Backspace&gt; key from within the Dialog character to delete Dialog elements if both the character and text are blank. In other words:\n\n    $('.dialog input[@name=character]').bind('keypress[backspace]', function() {\n      $(this).fn('dialog').fn('delete');\n    });\n\n    $('.dialog').fn({\n      delete: function() {\n        if ($(this).fn('isBlank'))\n          $.delete($(this).attr('url'), $(this).remove);\n      },\n      isBlank: function() {\n        return $(this).find('input[@name=character]').val() == \"\" &&\n               $(this).find('input[@name=text]').val() == \"\";\n      },\n    });\n\nUsing the technique shown in the previous section, the character input is given a reference to the dialog (omitted here).\n\n### Polymorphism in Concrete Javascript ###\n\nWe'd like to add a similar delete feature to Scenes. When the user hits &lt;Backspace&gt; while in the Video textarea it should delete the Scene--but only if the Video is blank and so are *each* of the Dialog elements within the Scene.\n\nFirst, let's define `isBlank` on Scene:\n\n    $('.scene').fn({\n      isBlank: function() {\n        return $(this).fn('video').fn('isBlank') &&\n               $.all($(this).find('.dialog'), function(dialog) {\n                 return $(dialog).fn('isBlank')\n               })\n      }\n    });\n\nAt this point, we may notice that the definition of delete is the same for Scene as for Dialog. Thus,\n\n    $('.scene, .dialog').fn({\n      delete: function() {\n        if ($(this).fn('isBlank'))\n          $.delete($(this).attr('url'), $(this).remove);\n      }\n    });\n\nSo now we have achieved a kind of polymorphism: Both Scenes and Dialogs respond to `isBlank`, though each have differing implementations. Each has a different `url` attribute and each (given that they are DOM objects) can be `removed`. Given that they conform to the same interface, we can implement a generic `delete` method for both of them.\n",

    "Readme": "== Welcome to Rails\n\nRails is a web-application framework that includes everything needed to create \ndatabase-backed web applications according to the Model-View-Control pattern. \n\nThis pattern splits the view (also called the presentation) into \"dumb\" templates\nthat are primarily responsible for inserting pre-built data in between HTML tags.\nThe model contains the \"smart\" domain objects (such as Account, Product, Person,\nPost) that holds all the business logic and knows how to persist themselves to\na database. The controller handles the incoming requests (such as Save New Account,\nUpdate Product, Show Post) by manipulating the model and directing data to the view.\n\nIn Rails, the model is handled by what's called an object-relational mapping\nlayer entitled Active Record. This layer allows you to present the data from\ndatabase rows as objects and embellish these data objects with business logic\nmethods. You can read more about Active Record in\nlink:files/vendor/rails/activerecord/README.html.\n\nThe controller and view are handled by the Action Pack, which handles both\nlayers by its two parts: Action View and Action Controller. These two layers\nare bundled in a single package due to their heavy interdependence. This is\nunlike the relationship between the Active Record and Action Pack that is much\nmore separate. Each of these packages can be used independently outside of\nRails.  You can read more about Action Pack in\nlink:files/vendor/rails/actionpack/README.html.\n\n\n== Getting Started\n\n1. At the command prompt, start a new Rails application using the <tt>rails</tt> command\n   and your application name. Ex: rails myapp\n2. Change directory into myapp and start the web server: <tt>script/server</tt> (run with --help for options)\n3. Go to http://localhost:3000/ and get \"Welcome aboard: You're riding the Rails!\"\n4.

    "Readme": "Motivation\nNormally when I create a new website with code on it, I write it as static files.  I'd take all the stuff that stayed the same on each page (header, footer, sidebar generally) and shove it into external files, which can then be included into each page manually.\nOf course you end up forgetting to add an include() here and there, and the website breaks until you fix it.  So I got fed up and started looking at full blown CMS's.\nAfter testing a couple out, I realised why I'd hate them.  They are all (generally) database based.  Its a good idea for multiple people editing, etc, but its a pain in the arse to backup.  You have to export your data from the database & then backup that file.  Then you have to either remember to do that every so often, or when data is updated.\nPlus when you are testing you have to keep messing around with databases in setting them up and deleting them.  And I thought, \"Why can't a website be file based, but not have to be so dependent on includes?\"\nThen I started to realise something.  All web based CMS's that use a database work inherently different at a basic level to static file inclusion systems.  They pull the content into the layout, rather than the layout into the content.\nFor example, wordpress pulls the content straight out of the database in the form of posts & pages, and inserts it into the theme (layout) before rendering it to the browser.\nWith the including system, I am requesting the layout (header.php, footer.php, etc) from within the content (about.php, etc), so I am sucking the layout into the content.\nBut what, I thought, if there was a system that used files, but still pulled the content into the layout, so each file only contained the content for that page.\nAnd thus I wrote Soco.\nUsage\n\nClone the git repo by running git clone git://github.com/caius/soco.git\nEdit the content files in /content\n\n",

Yardoc Meta-tag Formatting Like Python, Java, Objective-C and other languages:\nYARD uses a '@tag' style definition syntax for meta tags alongside  regular code\ndocumentation. These tags should be able to happily sit side by side RDoc formatted\ndocumentation, but provide a much more consistent and usable way to describe\nimportant information about objects, such as what parameters they take and what types\nthey are expected to be, what type a method should return, what exceptions it can\nraise, if it is deprecated, etc.. It also allows information to be better (and more\nconsistently) organized during the output generation phase. You can find a list\nof tags in the {file:docs/Tags.md#taglist Tags.md} file.\nYARD also supports an optional \"types\" declarations for certain tags.\nThis allows the developer to document type signatures for ruby methods and\nparameters in a non intrusive but helpful and consistent manner. Instead of\ndescribing this data in the body of the description, a developer may formally\ndeclare the parameter or return type(s) in a single line. Consider the\nfollowing method documented with YARD formatting:\n# Reverses the contents of a String or IO object.\n#\n# @param [String, #read] contents the contents to reverse\n# @return [String] the contents reversed lexically\ndef reverse(contents)\n  contents = contents.read if contents.respond_to? :read\n  contents.reverse\nend\nWith the above @param tag, we learn that the contents parameter can either be\na String or any object that responds to the 'read' method, which is more\npowerful than the textual description, which says it should be an IO object.\nThis also informs the developer that they should expect to receive a String\nobject returned by the method, and although this may be obvious for a\n'reverse' method, it becomes very useful when the method name may not be as\ndescriptive.\n3. Custom Constructs and Extensibility of YARD: YARD is designed to be\nextended and customized by plugins. Take for instance the scenario where you\nneed to document the following code:\nclass List\n # Sets the publisher name for the list.\n cattr_accessor :publisher\nend\nThis custom declaration provides dynamically generated code that is hard for a\ndocumentation tool to properly document without help from the developer. To\nease the pains of manually documenting the procedure, YARD can be extended by\nthe developer to handle the cattr_accessor construct and automatically create\nan attribute on the class with the associated documentation. This makes\ndocumenting external API's, especially dynamic ones, a lot more consistent for\nconsumption by the users.\nYARD is also designed for extensibility everywhere else, allowing you to add\nsupport for new programming languages, new data structures and even where/how\ndata is stored.\n4. Raw Data Output: YARD also outputs documented objects as raw data (the\ndumped Namespace) which can be reloaded to do generation at a later date, or\neven auditing on code. This means that any developer can use the raw data to\nperform output generation for any custom format, such as YAML, for instance.\nWhile YARD plans to support XHTML style documentation output as well as\ncommand line (text based) and possibly XML, this may still be useful for those\nwho would like to reap the benefits of YARD's processing in other forms, such\nas throwing all the documentation into a database. Another useful way of\nexploiting this raw data format would be to write tools that can auto generate\ntest cases, for example, or show possible unhandled exceptions in code.\n5. Local Documentation Server: YARD can serve documentation for projects\nor installed gems (similar to gem server) with the added benefit of dynamic\nsearching, as well as live reloading. Using the live reload feature, you can\ndocument your code and immediately preview the results by refreshing the page;\nYARD will do all the work in re-generating the HTML. This makes writing\ndocumentation a much faster process.\nInstalling\nTo install YARD, use the following command:\n$ gem install yard\n(Add sudo if you're installing under a POSIX system as root)\nAlternatively, if you've checked the source out directly, you can call\nrake install from the root project directory.\nImportant Note for Debian/Ubuntu users: there's a possible chance your Ruby\ninstall lacks RDoc, which is occasionally used by YARD to convert markup to HTML.\nIf running which rdoc turns up empty, install RDoc by issuing:\n$ sudo apt-get install rdoc\nUsage\nThere are a couple of ways to use YARD. The first is via command-line, and the\nsecond is the Rake task.\n1. yard Command-line Tool\nYARD comes packaged with a executable named yard which can control the many\nfunctions of YARD, including generating documentation, graphs running the\nYARD server, and so on. To view a list of available YARD commands, type:\n$ yard --help\nPlugins can also add commands to the yard executable to provide extra\nfunctionality.\nGenerating Documentation\nThe yardoc executable is a shortcut for yard doc.\nThe most common command you will probably use is yard doc, or yardoc. You\ncan type yardoc --help to see the options that YARD provides, but the\neasiest way to generate docs for your code is to simply type yardoc in your\nproject root. This will assume your files are\nlocated in the lib/ directory. If they are located elsewhere, you can specify\npaths and globs from the commandline via:\n$ yardoc 'lib/**/*.rb' 'app/**/*.rb' ...etc...\nThe tool will generate a .yardoc file which will store the cached database\nof your source code and documentation. If you want to re-generate your docs\nwith another template you can simply use the --use-cache (or -c)\noption to speed up the generation process by skipping source parsing.\nYARD will by default only document code in your public visibility. You can\ndocument your protected and private code by adding --protected or\n--private to the option switches. In addition, you can add --no-private\nto also ignore any object that has the @private meta-tag. This is similar\nto RDoc's \":nodoc:\" behaviour, though the distinction is important. RDoc\nimplies that the object with :nodoc: would not be documented, whereas\nYARD still recommends documenting private objects for the private API (for\nmaintainer/developer consumption).\nYou can also add extra informative files (README, LICENSE) by separating\nthe globs and the filenames with '-'.\n$ yardoc 'app/**/*.rb' - README LICENSE FAQ\nIf no globs precede the '-' argument, the default glob (lib/**/*.rb) is\nused:\n$ yardoc - README LICENSE FAQ\nNote that the README file can be specified with its own --readme switch.\nYou can also add a .yardopts file to your project directory which lists\nthe switches separated by whitespace (newlines or space) to pass to yardoc\nwhenever it is run. A full overview of the .yardopts file can be found in\n{YARD::CLI::Yardoc}.\nQueries\nThe yardoc tool also supports a --query argument to only include objects\nthat match a certain data or meta-data query. The query syntax is Ruby, though\na few shortcuts are available. For instance, to document only objects that have\nan \"@api\" tag with the value \"public\", all of the following syntaxes would give\nthe same result:\n--query '@api.text == \"public\"'\n--query 'object.has_tag?(:api) && object.tag(:api).text == \"public\"'\n--query 'has_tag?(:api) && tag(:api).text == \"public\"'\nNote that the \"@tag\" syntax returns the first tag named \"tag\" on the object.\nTo return the array of all tags named \"tag\", use \"@@tag\".\nMultiple --query arguments are allowed in the command line parameters. The\nfollowing two lines both check for the existence of a return and param tag:\n--query '@return' --query '@param'\n--query '@return && @param'\nFor more information about the query syntax, see the {YARD::Verifier} class.\n2. Rake Task\nThe second most obvious is to generate docs via a Rake task. You can do this by\nadding the following to your Rakefile:\nYARD::Rake::YardocTask.new do |t|\n t.files   = ['lib/**/*.rb', OTHER_PATHS]   # optional\n t.options = ['--any', '--extra', '--opts'] # optional\n t.stats_options = ['--list-undoc']         # optional\nend\nAll the settings: files, options and stats_options are optional. files will default to\nlib/**/*.rb, options will represents any options you might want\nto add and stats_options will pass extra options to the stats command.\nAgain, a full list of options is available by typing yardoc --help\nin a shell. You can also override the options at the Rake command-line with the\nOPTS environment variable:\n$ rake yard OPTS='--any --extra --opts'\n3. yri RI Implementation\nThe yri binary will use the cached .yardoc database to give you quick ri-style\naccess to your documentation. It's way faster than ri but currently does not\nwork with the stdlib or core Ruby libraries, only the active project. Example:\n$ yri YARD::Handlers::Base#register\n$ yri File.relative_path\nNote that class methods must not be referred to with the \"::\" namespace\nseparator. Only modules, classes and constants should use \"::\".\nYou can also do lookups on any installed gems. Just make sure to build the\n.yardoc databases for installed gems with:\n$ yard gems\nIf you don't have sudo access, it will write these files to your ~/.yard\ndirectory. yri will also cache lookups there.\n4. yard server Documentation Server\nThe yard server command serves documentation for a local project or all installed\nRubyGems. To serve documentation for a project you are working on, simply run:\n$ yard server\nAnd the project inside the current directory will be parsed (if the source has\nnot yet been scanned by YARD) and served at http://localhost:8808.\nLive Reloading\nIf you want to serve documentation on a project while you document it so that\nyou can preview the results, simply pass --reload (-r) to the above command\nand YARD will reload any changed files on each request. This will allow you to\nchange any documentation in the source and refresh to see the new contents.\nServing Gems\nTo serve documentation for all installed gems, call:\n$ yard server --gems\nThis will also automatically build documentation for any gems that have not\nbeen previously scanned. Note that in this case there will be a slight delay\nbetween the first request of a newly parsed gem.\n5. yard graph Graphviz Generator\nYou can use yard graph to generate dot graphs of your code. This, of course,\nrequires Graphviz and the dot binary. By default\nthis will generate a graph of the classes and modules in the best UML2 notation\nthat Graphviz can support, but without any methods listed. With the --full\noption, methods and attributes will be listed. There is also a --dependencies\noption to show mixin inclusions. You can output to stdout or a file, or pipe directly\nto dot. The same public, protected and private visibility rules apply to yard graph.\nMore options can be seen by typing yard graph --help, but here is an example:\n$ yard graph --protected --full --dependencies\nChangelog\nSee {file:CHANGELOG.md} for a list of changes.\nLicense\nYARD \u00a9 2007-2016 by Loren Segal.

    "Readme": "Castanaut: Automate your screencasts.\nAuthor: Joseph Pearson\nhttp://gadgets.inventivelabs.com.au/castanaut\nDESCRIPTION\nCastanaut lets you write executable scripts for your screencasts. With a\nsimple dictionary of stage directions, you can create complex interactions\nwith a variety of applications. Currently, and for the foreseeable future,\nCastanaut supports Mac OS X 10.5 only.\nSYNOPSIS\nWriting screenplays\nYou write your screenplays as Ruby files. Castanaut has been designed to\nread fairly naturally to the non-technical, within Ruby's constraints.\nHere's a simple screenplay:\nlaunch \"Safari\", at(10, 10, 800, 600)\ntype \"http://www.inventivelabs.com.au\"\nhit Enter\npause 2\nmove to(100, 100)\nmove to(200, 100)\nmove to(200, 200)\nmove to(100, 200)\nmove to(100, 100)\nsay \"I drew a square!\"\n\nWith any luck we don't need to explain to you what this screenplay\ndoes. The only thing that might need some explanation is \"say\" -- this has a\nrobotic voice speak the given string. (Also: all numbers are pixel\nco-ordinates).\nAbout the robot: no, we don't recommend you use this in real screencasts for\na large audience. Most people find it a little offputting.\nYou are free to contravene our recommendation though. You\ncan tweak the robot in the Mac OS X Speech Preferences pane.\nRunning your screenplay\nSimply give the screenplay to the castanaut command, like this:\ncastanaut test.screenplay\n\nThis assumes you have a screenplay file called \"test.screenplay\" in the\ndirectory where you are running the command.\nOf course, it isn't always convenient to drop to the terminal to run your\nscreenplay. So there's also a method of executing your screenplays directly.\nYou need to add this line (the \"shebang\" line) at the top of your screenplay:\n#!/usr/bin/env castanaut\n\nThen you need to set the screenplay to be executable by running this command\non it:\nchmod a+x test.screenplay\n\nAgain, substitute \"test.screenplay\" for your screenplay's filename.\nAt this point, you should be able to double-click the screenplay, or invoke\nit with Quicksilver, or run it any other way that floats your boat.\nStopping the screenplay\nIf you want to abruptly terminate execution before the end of the screenplay,\nyou just need to run the 'castanaut' command again -- with or without any\narguments.\nOf course, that might be easier said than done, if you haven't got full\ncontrol of the mouse or keyboard at the time. One recommendation is to assign\na system hot-key to invoke castanaut. I use a Quicksilver trigger for this,\nassigned to Shift-F1, that calls castanaut. You'll need the full path to\nthe command for this, which is usually /usr/bin/castanaut, but you can check\nit with the following command:\nwhich \"castanaut\"\n\nRunning interactively with IRB\nYou can now run Castanaut interactively from IRB \u2014 to test commands, try stuff\nout, etc:\n$ irb -r 'castanaut'\n>> irb Castanaut::Movie.spawn\n>> move to(100, 100)\n=> \"Moving mouse.\\n\"\n\nNote that this technique creates an IRB subsession, so you'll have to exit out\nof that before exiting out of IRB. There's heaps you can do with subsessions -\nread up about them online.\nWhat stage directions can I make?\nOut of the box, Castanaut performs mouse actions, keyboard actions,\nrobot speech and application launches.\nFor a complete overview of the built-in stage directions, see the\nCastanaut::Movie class.\nUsing plugins\nOf course, just using the built-in stage directions is a little bit awkward\nand verbose. Plugins allow you to extend the available dictionary with\nsome additional convenience actions. Typically a plugin is specific to an\napplication.\nCastanaut comes with several plugins, including\n\nCastanaut::Plugin::Safari for interacting with the contents of web-pages\nCastanaut::Plugin::Ishowu for recording screencasts using the iShowU\napplication from Shiny White Box.\nCastanaut::Plugin::Textmate for opening files to specific line numbers.\n\nTo use a plugin, simply declare it:\nplugin \"safari\"\n\nlaunch \"Safari\", at(32, 32, 800, 600)\nurl \"http://www.google.com\"\npause 4\nmove to_element('input[name=\"q\"]')\nclick\ntype \"Castanaut\"\nmove to_element('input[type=\"submit\"]')\nclick\npause 4\nsay \"Oh. I was hoping for more results.\"\n\nIn the example above, we use the two methods provided by the Safari module:\nurl, which causes Safari to navigate to the given url, and to_element, which\nreturns the co-ordinates of a page element (using CSS selectors) relative to\nthe screen.\nCreating your own plugins\nAdvanced users can create their own plugins. Put them in a directory\ncalled \"plugins\" below the directory containing the screenplays that use\nthe plugin.\nTake a look at the plugins that Castanaut comes with for examples on creating\nyour own.\nREQUIREMENTS\n\nMac OS X 10.5 or higher\n\nor\n\nMac OS X 10.4\nThe Extras Suite application\n\nINSTALL\nRun the following command to install Castanaut\ngem install castanaut\n\nIf you're using Mac OS X 10.4 (Tiger) you will also need to download and\ninstall the XTool scripting additions.\nOnce installed, you should run the following command for two reasons:\ncastanaut\n\nReason 1 is to confirm that it is installed correctly. Reason 2 is to set up\nthe permissions on the utility that controls your mouse and keyboard during\nCastanaut movies. You may be asked for a password here.\nIf you just see a \"ScreenplayNotFound\" exception here, everything's good.\nLICENSE\nCopyright (C) 2008-2011 Inventive Labs.\nReleased under the WTFPL.\nPortions released under the MIT License.\nSee COPYRIGHT.md for full licensing details.\n",

    "Readme": "== Welcome to Rails\n\nRails is a web-application and persistence framework that includes everything\nneeded to create database-backed web-applications according to the\nModel-View-Control pattern of separation. This pattern splits the view (also\ncalled the presentation) into \"dumb\" templates that are primarily responsible\nfor inserting pre-built data in between HTML tags. The model contains the\n\"smart\" domain objects (such as Account, Product, Person, Post) that holds all\nthe business logic and knows how to persist themselves to a database. The\ncontroller handles the incoming requests (such as Save New Account, Update\nProduct, Show Post) by manipulating the model and directing data to the view.\n\nIn Rails, the model is handled by what's called an object-relational mapping\nlayer entitled Active Record. This layer allows you to present the data from\ndatabase rows as objects and embellish these data objects with business logic\nmethods. You can read more about Active Record in\nlink:files/vendor/rails/activerecord/README.html.\n\nThe controller and view are handled by the Action Pack, which handles both\nlayers by its two parts: Action View and Action Controller. These two layers\nare bundled in a single package due to their heavy interdependence. This is\nunlike the relationship between the Active Record and Action Pack that is much\nmore separate. Each of these packages can be used independently outside of\nRails.  You can read more about Action Pack in\nlink:files/vendor/rails/actionpack/README.html.\n\n\n== Getting Started\n\n1. At the command prompt, start a new Rails application using the <tt>rails</tt> command\n   and your application name. Ex: rails myapp\n   (If you've downloaded Rails in a complete tgz or zip, this step is already done)\n2. Change directory into myapp and start the web server: <tt>script/server</tt> (run with --help for options)\n3. Go to http://localhost:3000/ and get \"Welcome aboard: You\u2019re riding the Rails!\"\n4. Follow the guidelines to start developing your application\n\n\n== Web Servers\n\nBy default, Rails will try to use Mongrel and lighttpd if they are installed, otherwise\nRails will use WEBrick, the webserver that ships with Ruby. When you run script/server,\nRails will check if Mongrel exists, then lighttpd and finally fall back to WEBrick. This ensures\nthat you can always get up and running quickly.\n\nMongrel is a Ruby-based webserver with a C component (which requires compilation) that is\nsuitable for development and deployment of Rails applications. If you have Ruby Gems installed,\ngetting up and running with mongrel is as easy as: <tt>gem install mongrel</tt>.\nMore info at: http://mongrel.rubyforge.org\n\nIf Mongrel is not installed, Rails will look for lighttpd. It's considerably faster than\nMongrel and WEBrick and also suited for production use, but requires additional\ninstallation and currently only works well on OS X/Unix (Windows users are encouraged\nto start with Mongrel). We recommend version 1.4.11 and higher. You can download it from\nhttp://www.lighttpd.net.\n\nAnd finally, if neither Mongrel or lighttpd are installed, Rails will use the built-in Ruby\nweb server, WEBrick. WEBrick is a small Ruby web server suitable for development, but not\nfor production.\n\nBut of course its also possible to run Rails on any platform that supports FCGI.\nApache, LiteSpeed, IIS are just a few. For more information on FCGI,\nplease visit: http://wiki.rubyonrails.com/rails/pages/FastCGI\n\n\n== Debugging Rails\n\nSometimes your application goes wrong.  Fortunately there are a lot of tools that\nwill help you debug it and get it back on the rails.\n\nFirst area to check is the application log files.  Have \"tail -f\" commands running\non the server.log and development.log. Rails will automatically display debugging\nand runtime information to these files. Debugging info will also be shown in the\nbrowser on requests from 127.0.0.1.\n\nYou can also log your own messages directly into the log file from your code using\nthe Ruby logger class from inside your controllers. Example:\n\n  class WeblogController < ActionController::Base\n    def destroy\n      @weblog = Weblog.find(params[:id])\n      @weblog.destroy\n      logger.info(\"#{Time.now} Destroyed Weblog ID ##{@weblog.id}!\")\n    end\n  end\n\nThe result will be a message in your log file along the lines of:\n\n  Mon Oct 08 14:22:29 +1000 2007 Destroyed Weblog ID #1\n\nMore information on how to use the logger is at http://www.ruby-doc.org/core/\n\nAlso, Ruby documentation can be found at http://www.ruby-lang.org/ including:\n\n* The Learning Ruby (Pickaxe) Book: http://www.ruby-doc.org/docs/ProgrammingRuby/\n* Learn to Program: http://pine.fm/LearnToProgram/  (a beginners guide)\n\nThese two online (and free) books will bring you up to speed on the Ruby language\nand also on programming in general.\n\n\n== Debugger\n\nDebugger support is available through the debugger command when you start your Mongrel or\nWebrick server with --debugger. This means that you can break out of execution at any point\nin the code, investigate and change the model, AND then resume execution! Example:\n\n  class WeblogController < ActionController::Base\n    def index\n      @posts = Post.find(:all)\n      debugger\n    end\n  end\n\nSo the controller will accept the action, run the first line, then present you\nwith a IRB prompt in the server window. Here you can do things like:\n\n  >> @posts.inspect\n  => \"[#<Post:0x14a6be8 @attributes={\\\"title\\\"=>nil, \\\"body\\\"=>nil, \\\"id\\\"=>\\\"1\\\"}>,\n       #<Post:0x14a6620 @attributes={\\\"title\\\"=>\\\"Rails you know!\\\", \\\"body\\\"=>\\\"Only ten..\\\", \\\"id\\\"=>\\\"2\\\"}>]\"\n  >> @posts.first.title = \"hello from a debugger\"\n  => \"hello from a debugger\"\n\n...and even better is that you can examine how your runtime objects actually work:\n\n  >> f = @posts.first\n  => #<Post:0x13630c4 @attributes={\"title\"=>nil, \"body\"=>nil, \"id\"=>\"1\"}>\n  >> f.\n  Display all 152 possibilities? (y or n)\n\nFinally, when you're ready to resume execution, you enter \"cont\"\n\n\n== Console\n\nYou can interact with the domain model by starting the console through <tt>script/console</tt>.\nHere you'll have all parts of the application configured, just like it is when the\napplication is running. You can inspect domain models, change values, and save to the\ndatabase. Starting the script without arguments will launch it in the development environment.\nPassing an argument will specify a different environment, like <tt>script/console production</tt>.\n\nTo reload your controllers and models after launching the console run <tt>reload!</tt>\n\n\n== Description of Contents\n\napp\n  Holds all the code that's specific to this particular application.\n\napp/controllers\n  Holds controllers that should be named like weblogs_controller.rb for\n  automated URL mapping. All controllers should descend from ApplicationController\n  which itself descends from ActionController::Base.\n\napp/models\n  Holds models that should be named like post.rb.\n  Most models will descend from ActiveRecord::Base.\n\napp/views\n  Holds the template files for the view that should be named like\n  weblogs/index.erb for the WeblogsController#index action. All views use eRuby\n  syntax.\n\napp/views/layouts\n  Holds the template files for layouts to be used with views. This models the common\n  header/footer method of wrapping views. In your views, define a layout using the\n  <tt>layout :default</tt> and create a file named default.erb. Inside default.erb,\n  call <% yield %> to render the view using this layout.\n\napp/helpers\n  Holds view helpers that should be named like weblogs_helper.rb. These are generated\n  for you automatically when using script/generate for controllers. Helpers can be used to\n  wrap functionality for your views into methods.\n\nconfig\n  Configuration files for the Rails environment, the routing map, the database, and other dependencies.\n\ndb\n  Contains the database schema in schema.rb.  db/migrate contains all\n  the sequence of Migrations for your schema.\n\ndoc\n  This directory is where your application documentation will be stored when generated\n  using <tt>rake doc:app</tt>\n\nlib\n  Application specific libraries. Basically, any kind of custom code that doesn't\n  belong under controllers, models, or helpers. This directory is in the load path.\n\npublic\n  The directory available for the web server. Contains subdirectories for images, stylesheets,\n  and javascripts. Also contains the dispatchers and the default HTML files. This should be\n  set as the DOCUMENT_ROOT of your web server.\n\nscript\n  Helper scripts for automation and generation.\n\ntest\n  Unit and functional tests along with fixtures. When using the script/generate scripts, template\n  test files will be generated for you and placed in this directory.\n\nvendor\n  External libraries that the application depends on.

For example, to install a Rails or Merb stack on a brand new slice directly after\nits been created.\n \n\n#sprinkle channel on the Freenode IRC Network\nhttp://redartisan.com/2008/5/27/sprinkle-intro\nhttp://github.com/sprinkle-tool/sprinkle\nhttp://github.com/benschwarz/passenger-stack\nhttp://github.com/trevorturk/sprinkle-packages\nhttp://www.vimeo.com/2888665\nhttp://maxim.github.com/sprinkle-cheatsheet\nhttp://github.com/mingalar/sprinkle-packages\nhttp://github.com/stuartellis/spritz\nhttp://engineering.gomiso.com/2011/08/26/forget-chef-or-puppet-automate-with-sprinkle/\n\nPackages\nProperties of packages such as their name, type, dependencies, etc, and what packages apply to what machines\nis described via a domain specific language that Sprinkle executes (in fact one of the aims of Sprinkle is to\ndefine as concisely as possible a language for installing software).\nAn example:\npackage :ruby do\n  description 'Ruby Virtual Machine'\n  version '1.8.6'\n  source \"ftp://ftp.ruby-lang.org/pub/ruby/1.8/ruby-#{version}-p111.tar.gz\"\n  requires :ruby_dependencies\n\n  verify do\n    has_file '/usr/bin/ruby'\n  end\nend\nThis defines a package called ruby, that uses the source based installer to build Ruby 1.8.6 from source,\ninstalling the package ruby_dependencies beforehand. The package verifies it was installed correctly by verifying the file /usr/bin/ruby exists after installation. If this verification fails, the sprinkle script will gracefully stop.\nReasonable defaults are set by sprinkle, such as the install prefix, download area, etc, but can be customized\nglobally or per package (see below for an example).\nSince packages come in many forms (eg. gems, pre-compiled debs, compressed source tar.gz, etc), Sprinkle supports\nmany different installer types, giving you the most amount of flexibility of how you'd like software installed.\nNew installer types can be added into the system easily.\nFor example, you could install Rails via gems, nginx via source, and mysql via APT, while retaining the flexibility\nof changing installer types as software is updated upstream.\nSprinkle also supports dependencies between packages, allowing you specify pre-requisites that need to be\ninstalled in order.\nPolicies\nPackages can be grouped into polices to define several packages that should be installed together.  An example:\npolicy :rails, :roles => :app do\n  requires :rails, :version => \"3.2\"\n  requires :appserver\n  requires :database\n  requires :webserver\nend\nThis defines a policy called Rails, that applies to machines of role :app. The policy includes the packages\nrails (version 3.2), appserver, database and webserver.\nThe appserver, database and webserver packages can also be virtual, prompting the user for selection if multiple choices for the virtual package exist.\nSprinkle is architected to be extendable in many ways, one of those areas is in its deployment of commands to\nremote hosts. Currently Sprinkle supports the use of Capistrano, Vlad, or a direct net/ssh connection to\nissue commands on remote hosts via ssh, but could also be extended to use any other command transport mechanism\ndesired. Sprinkle can also be configured to simply issue installation commands to provision the local system.\nSprinkle is a work in progress and I'm excited to hear if anyone finds it useful - please feel free to\ncomment, ask any questions, or send in any ideas, patches, bugs.

    "Readme": "== Utility Belt\n\nby Giles Bowkett (and many others)\n\nhttp://utilitybelt.rubyforge.org\n\n== DESCRIPTION\n\nUtility Belt is a grab-bag of tricks, tools, techniques, trifles, and toys for IRB, including convenience methods, language patches, and useful extensions. It also includes a couple command-line widgets. Its primary inspirations were an awesome gem called Wirble and a blog post by Amy Hoy called \"Secrets Of The Rails Console Ninjas\".\n\n(http://slash7.com/articles/2006/12/21/secrets-of-the-rails-console-ninjas)\n\n== INSTALL\n\nsudo gem install utility_belt\n\n== FEATURES\n\n* Interactively edit IRB code in your preferred text editor\n* Read from and write to OS X clipboard\n* Post your code to Pastie with one command (OS X only)\n* Kick-ass Unix-style history buffer\n* Write command history to file or vi\n* Grep classes and methods for strings\n* Verbosity controls for regular IRB and Rails console\n* Finder shortcuts for Rails console\n* Upload shortcut for Amazon S3\n* Command-line Amazon S3 upload script\n* Command-line Google shortcut (OS X only)\n* Auto-indentation\n* _ special variable (like Unix shell var !!)\n* Extremely basic themes for Wirble syntax coloring\n* Pascal/JavaScript-style \"with\" statement\n* String#to_proc\n* Add and subtract Hashes with + and -\n* Grammatically-correct is_an? method - no more \"is_a? Array\" statements\n* One-character exit command\n\n== COMMUNITY EFFORT\n\nThe majority of this code was written by other people and compiled, nicked, nabbed, herded, gathered, copied, or pilfered by me (Giles Bowkett). See copyright notice for the credits. A lot of this code comes from blogs. Check out the source code for numerous links to the original posts the code came from. Thanks also to Bob Hutchison, Avdi Grimm, Marcus Derencius, Markus Prinz, Ben Bleything, Reginald Braithwaite-Lee, and Robert Berger for bug fixes, new features, documentation, and bug reports.\n\n== SYNOPSIS\n\nUtility Belt gives you a ton of new options and techniques in IRB. (You may find yourself putting its language patches in actual projects as well.) The way to use Utility Belt is to edit, or create, your .irbrc file. This is analogous to a Unix .bashrc, .tcshrc, .profile, or similar file.\n\nWindows users have a couple options. The easiest is to define an environment variable called IRBRC and set it to the full path of your irbrc (e.g. \"C:\\Documents and Settings\\<username>\\_irbrc\"). Presto, .irbrc for Windows. You could also set your HOME-Variable to any directory you want and put your \".irbrc\" in there. (It needs to be called \".irbrc\", \"_irbrc\" won't work). Since Windows Explorer won't let you create a file with a dot in the beginning, use any text editor (Notepad will do just fine) and \"Save As\" to save it as \".irbrc\". (The quotation marks make the magic happen.) We don't recommend this if you're also using MSYS or Cygwin, as they use the same variable for their own purposes.\n\nAdding Utility Belt to your .irbrc is easy:\n\n  require 'rubygems'\n  require 'utility_belt'\n\nTo use the Amazon shortcuts, you also need to set some environment variables. See the section on S3 under \"Usage\" for more. Also, if your terminal has a light background, you'll need to enable the light-background syntax coloring theme - see the section on themes under \"Usage\" for more.\n\n== USAGE\n\nUsing each of Utility Belt's tools is different:\n\n== Interactively edit IRB code in your preferred text editor\n\nIf your preferred text editor is vi(m), emacs, or TextMate, there are built-in commands: vi, emacs, and mate, respectively. To use another editor, use this command:\n\n  edit_interactively(:the_name_of_my_editor)\n\nor\n\n  edit_interactively(\"the name of my editor\")\n\nor\n\n  edit_interactively(\"/the/path/to/my/editor\")\n\nIf you're wondering why the method name is so ridiculously long, there's a story there:\n\nhttp://gilesbowkett.blogspot.com/2007/12/utility-belt-vs-rails.html\n\n== Read from and write to OS X or Windows clipboard\n\nIn order to use Clipboard on Windows you must install the 'win32-clipboard' gem.\n\nTo read:\n\n  Clipboard.read\n\nTo write:\n\n  Clipboard.write(\"something\")\n\n== Post your code to Pastie with one command (OS X and Windows only)\n\nYou must first equip the UtilityBelt with pastie in your .irbrc:\n\n  UtilityBelt.equip(:pastie)\n\nThis line will also automatically equip the Clipboard, which is required to use pastie.\n\nFirst copy some code into your clipboard, or put it there with the Clipboard.write() class method. Then use the command:\n\n  pastie\n\nor the shortcut version:\n\n  pst\n\nNote that this method currently auto-formats all code as Ruby. Support for other languages is possible but not implemented yet. Also, this code is OS X and Windows only because it uses the Clipboard. (A platform-agnostic version without the clipboard aspect is certainly possible.)\n\n== Unix-style history buffer\n\nUse \"h\" or \"history\" to view your command history, and \"h! 123\" to re-invoke command #123 in your buffer. \"h!\" with no args will run the last command.\n\n== Write command history to file or vi\n\nTo write your history to a file, use \"history_write('/path/to/file')\". To edit your history in vi, use \"history_to_vi\" or its shortcut alias \"hvi\".\n\n== Grep classes and methods for strings\n\nClasses:\n\n  >> grep_classes(\"ixnum\")\n  #=> [\"Fixnum\"]\n\n  >> grep_classes(\"num\")\n  #=> [\"Bignum\", \"Fixnum\", \"Numeric\", \"REXML::SyncEnumerator\"]\n\nMethods:\n\n  >> \"any arbitrary string\".grep_methods(\"pretty\")\n  #=> [\"pretty_inspect\", \"pretty_print_instance_variables\", \"pretty_print_inspect\", \"pretty_print\", \"pretty_print_cycle\"]\n\n  >> 32.grep_methods(\"*\")\n  #=> [\"*\", \"**\"]\n\nAt some point it'll probably be a good idea to add regex support for these methods.\n\n== Verbosity controls for regular IRB and Rails console\n\nregular IRB: \"verbose\" or \"v\" / \"quiet\" or \"q\"\n\nRails: \"log\" method turns verbosity on, there isn't actually any method for turning it off. (Might add one at some point.)\n\n== Finder shortcuts for Rails console\n\n  user(:all) / user(1)\n\ninstead of\n\n  User.find(:all) / User.find(1)\n\nSupports arbitrarily complex finds.\n\n== Upload shortcut for Amazon S3\n\nFirst, define your secret keys in your environment variables:\n\nexport AMAZON_ACCESS_KEY_ID='foofoofoofoofoo'\nexport AMAZON_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY='barbarbarbarbar'\n\n(Obviously, replace those with actual values.)\n\nThen, you can use\n\n  aws_upload(\"bucket_name\",\"filename\")\n\nTo easily upload public-access files. This method will automatically connect to Amazon S3 for you, if your keys are defined in your environment variables. It also writes the resulting Amazon URL to your clipboard, if you're on OS X, so you can easily share the file with others. Note that you have to create the initial buckets manually - see amazon.rubyforge.org for details on that.\n\nA good way to use this is actually to have a default bucket, and create a further method in your .irbrc file:\n\n  def my_bucket_name(filename)\n    aws_upload(\"my_default_bucket\",filename)\n  end\n\n== Command-line Amazon S3 upload script\n\nUtility Belt also includes amazon, a simple command-line uploader for S3. It requires that you set your Amazon environment variables (see above). The usage is:\n\n  amazon -b my_bucket_name filename other_filename\n\n(For any arbitrary number of filenames.)\n\nAnytime you want to upload a file to your default bucket on S3, for example, the \"images\" bucket for your blog - or the \"mp3\" bucket if you're running a blog like Projectionist - all you have to do is\n\n  amazon -b blog_files some_file.name\n\nOr\n\n  amazon --bucket blog_files some_file.name\n\nAnd you're good to go. Of course, if that were too many characters to type, you could always take it one step further with a shell script. For instance, in bash:\n\n  alias b1=\"amazon --bucket my_main_bucket $1\"\n  alias b2=\"amazon --bucket my_other_bucket $1\"\n\nAnd then you would only have to type:\n\n  b1 file.name\n\nAnd of course tab completion will handle all the typing of the file name, assuming you choose your file names deliberately ahead of time to make tab completion effective, in which case all you have to type is \"b1 f[tab]\" and bam.\n\n== Command-line Google shortcut (OS X only)\n\nTo pop open a new window in your default browser with Google search results for a given search term, do:\n\n  google \"any given term\"\n\nFor one-word terms, you can omit the quotes:\n\n  google term\n\nIf you already have the search term in your clipboard, you can just type:\n\n  google\n\n(The last approach is useful for unusual command-line error messages.)\n\n== Auto-indentation and tab completion\n\nJust type as normally. This just enables built-in but underused functionality in IRB. (The IRB default auto-indentation isn't perfect, but it clobbers the living hell out of no indentation at all.)\n\n== _ special variable (like Unix shell var !!)\n\nMore activation of built-in but underused functionality in IRB. _ functions like !! in Unix, with one subtle difference. Instead of re-issuing the previous command in your history, it gives you the last result of evaluating a command. This means when you start a new IRB session, _ won't go to your history, it'll just give you nil, and it means that some commands can't be repeated exactly. Nine out of ten times, however, it's pretty much the same thing.\n\nNote that when combined with the h! in the command history code, you basically have two synonyms for !! here. Neither one is an exact replica, but between the two of them, you should have what you need.\n\n== Extremely basic themes for Wirble syntax coloring\n\nUtility Belt incorporates Wirble as a dependency. Wirble provides syntax coloring. Utility Belt allows you to choose between two syntax coloring themes: Wirble's default, and an alternate color set for terminals with light backgrounds. The default theme is enabled by default (duh), but if you have a terminal with a light background, you can enable the light-background theme just by putting the following line of code in your .irbrc:\n\n  UtilityBelt::Themes.background(:light)\n\nTo revert back to the default, just use this:\n\n  UtilityBelt::Themes.background(:dark)\n\nTo specify an entirely new syntax color scheme, see the source code for this gem or for Wirble.\n\n== Pascal/JavaScript-style \"with\" statement\n\nI use this with RSpec's spec_helper. Instead of:\n\n  Spec::Runner.configure do |config|\n    config.use_transactional_fixtures = true\n    config.use_instantiated_fixtures  = false\n    config.fixture_path = RAILS_ROOT + '/spec/fixtures'\n    config.mock_with :flexmock\n  end\n\nI do this:\n\n  Spec::Runner.configure do |config|\n    with(config) do\n      use_transactional_fixtures = true\n      use_instantiated_fixtures  = false\n      fixture_path = RAILS_ROOT + '/spec/fixtures'\n      mock_with :flexmock\n    end\n  end\n\nNote however that this blew up once and I have no idea why. Caveat emptor, et cetera.\n\n== String#to_proc\n\nSyntactic sugar for functional programming.\n\n  (1..3).map(&'*2') => [2, 4, 6]\n  (1..3).map(&'[-1, _, 0]') => [[-1, 1, 0], [-1, 2, 0], [-1, 3, 0]]\n  (1..3).map(&'x -> y -> x * y').map(&'[2]') => [2, 4, 6]\n  (1..5).select(&'>2') => [3, 4, 5]\n  (1..3).map(&'x -> y -> x * y').map(&'.call(2)') => [2, 4, 6]\n  [5].map(&\"(1.._).inject(&'*')\") => [120]\n\nFor more detail see: http://weblog.raganwald.com/2007/10/stringtoproc.html\n\n== Add and subtract Hashes with + and -\n\n  {:a => :b} + {:c => :d} = {:a => :b, :c => :d}\n  {:a => :b, :c => :d} - {:c => :d} = {:a => :b}\n  {:a => :b, :c => :d} - :c = {:a => :b}\n\n  You could already do this with Arrays; now you can do it with Hashes as well. (I was kinda surprised the first time I tried to do this and realized I'd have to write it myself.)\n\n== Grammatically-correct is_an? method - no more \"is_a? Array\" statements\n\n  >> [].is_an? Array\n  #=> true\n\nMost people don't care, but personally, \"is_a? Array\" drives me completely insane.\n\n== Object#not\n\nReplace this:\n\n  if !response.incomplete? && !response.invalid? && response.total > 0\n\nWith this:\n\n  if response.not.incomplete? && response.not.invalid? && response.total > 0\n\nSyntactic sugar for boolean conditions.\n\nMore detail here:\n\nhttp://blog.jayfields.com/2007/08/ruby-adding-not-method-for-readability.html\n\n== One-character exit command\n\nx\n\nBecause life is too short to type whole words.\n\n== REQUIREMENTS\n\n* ReadLine\n* Wirble\n* Amazon S3\n* Platform\n* Some features require OS X\n\n== LICENSE\n\n  (The MIT License)\n\n  Copyright (c) 2006-2007 Giles Bowkett\n  Portions Copyright (c) 2006-2007 Ben Bleything\n  Portions Copyright (c) 2006-2007 Reginald Braithwaite\n  Portions Copyright (c) 2006-2007 Gregory Brown\n  Portions Copyright (c) 2006-2007 Jamis Buck\n  Portions Copyright (c) 2006-2007 Mike Clark\n  Portions Copyright (c) 2006-2007 Jay Fields\n  Portions Copyright (c) 2005 David Heinemeier Hansson\n  Portions Copyright (c) 2006-2007 Ara T.

    "Readme": "by labria:\n\nThis is a fork of the restful_authentication plugin including client certificate logon.\nIt's still totally raw, has too much hardcoded stuff and lacks some things, but you know,\n\"release early, release often\" =)\nIt add a new option, --use-certificates\n\nFirst of all, create a dir named \"cert\" in your rails root. I frankly don't know how to do\nit from the generator, I'll fix this later.\n\nSecond, after installing the plugin, edit the config/initializers/cert_config.rb with some\nof your data. Please, don't change the paths just yet. Actually, you can leave the defaults,\nexcept for domainname and hostname, you better hadrcode those to the server where you'll be\nusing this. Now, run \"rake cert:create_ca\", this will create theCA needed to sign your user \ncertficates. If you don't have a server certificate for your domain, you can create a self-\nsigned one using \"rake cert:server_cert\", using the options from the bottom of cert_config.rb\n\nNow, you have to configure your server. This is the tricky part. I'm using nginx, and here's\nwhat i did:\nIf the user comes with https without a cert, redirect him back to http. If he does have a\ncert, pass its subject string as the HTTP_X_SSL_CLIENT_S_DN header. You can see the config\nin one of my posts on the subject at http://blog.startika.com\nSo what you have to do, is to make your server pass the certificate string as X_SSL_CLIENT_S_DN\nto the app. I'm not sure how it's done with other servers, please send me instructions =)\n\nSo, now you have a UsersController#get_cert action, which gives the user his certificate in\na p12 file, and the https://youserver.com/session/new page which auto-logons the user if he\npresents his certificate. Not much, but it's still nice to provide such things.\n\nIf you have any questions, comments, suggestions or correction please contact me any way \nyou please, by email at labria@startika.com, for example.\n\n\nOriginal readme follows.\nRestful Authentication Generator\n====\n\nThis is a basic restful authentication generator for rails, taken \nfrom acts as authenticated.  Currently it requires Rails 1.2.6 or above.\n\nTo use:\n\n  ./script/generate authenticated user sessions \\\n        --include-activation \\\n        --stateful\n\nThe first parameter specifies the model that gets created in signup\n(typically a user or account model).  A model with migration is \ncreated, as well as a basic controller with the create method.\n\nThe second parameter specifies the sessions controller name.  This is\nthe controller that handles the actual login/logout function on the \nsite.\n\nThe third parameter (--include-activation) generates the code for a \nActionMailer and its respective Activation Code through email.\n\nThe fourth (--stateful) builds in support for acts_as_state_machine\nand generates activation code.  This was taken from:\n\nhttp://www.vaporbase.com/postings/stateful_authentication\n\nYou can pass --skip-migration to skip the user migration.\n\nIf you're using acts_as_state_machine, define your users resource like this:\n\n    map.resources :users, :member => { :suspend   => :put,\n                                     :unsuspend => :put,\n                                     :purge     => :delete }\n\nAlso, add an observer to config/environment.rb if you chose the \n--include-activation option\n\n  config.active_record.observers = :user_observer # or whatever you \n                                                                                                    # named your model\n\nSecurity Alert\n====\n\nI introduced a change to the model controller that's been tripping \nfolks up on Rails 2.0.

    "Name": "ruby-screen",
    "Readme": "RubyScreen\nRubyScreen is a utility for managing and launching GNU Screen configurations.  Though written in Ruby and requiring a valid Ruby installation, it should be useful for a developer in any language.  If you often find yourself opening up the same multiple windows and running various commands, or juggling multiple similar Screen configurations with various window setups, this may help.\nUsage is best described through a few examples, which are followed by detailed information on the available elements in the configuration file.\nInstallation\nRubyScreen is packaged as a Ruby Gem, and requires a valid installation of Ruby along with the RubyGems package manager.  Rather than document that process, you\u2019re likely to find more helpful instructions for installing those two components here at the Ruby on Rails installation page.\nOnce you have gems, you\u2019re just a command away:\ngem install ruby-screen\nOn non-Windows systems, you may need to use sudo to elevate you privileges.\nTo verify installation, try ruby-screen at your command prompt.  You should see a helpful message about your lack of configuration file.  You can build your own configuration file after reading the documentation below.\nExamples\nRubyScreen consists of a YAML configuration file and a command line utility.  The configuration file must be located in your home directory and named .ruby-screen.yml.  The simplest example:\n\nstartup_message: off\ndefscrollback: 5000\n\nThe command for launching RubyScreen is ruby-screen.  It will load your YAML configuration file and launch Screen with the appropriate options.  With the configuration file above, you\u2019ll have no splash screen and a 5000 line scroll buffer.  Not exactly revolutionary.\nLet\u2019s say you\u2019re a web developer working on a cool new project.  You\u2019re using your favorite text editor, watching some logs, keeping a window open for miscellaneous tasks.  Your configuration file would look something like this:\n\nstartup_message: off\ndefscrollback: 5000\n\ncool_site:\n  working_directory: ~/web_projects/cool_site\n  windows:\n    -\n      title: Editor\n      command: vim .\n    -\n      title: Misc\n    -\n      title: Logs\n      number: 9\n      command: tail -f /var/log/web_server.log\n\nNow you still have your generic configuration, along with an additional configuration for your cool project.  Running ruby-screen cool_site will move into your projects\u2019 directory and start a text editor, a window with a fresh command line, and a window tailing your server log.  The first two windows take whatever number Screen assigns to them (0 and 1 in this case), while the log window will always be assigned to number 9.\nThat\u2019s great, but you are working on more than just that one cool project.  You have multiple sites located in ~/web_projects, and they all have they all have similar needs: an editor, a terminal, and a log viewer.\n\nstartup_message: off\ndefscrollback: 5000\n\nweb_work:\n  working_directory: ~/web_projects\n  windows:\n    -\n      title: Editor\n      command: vim .\n    -\n      title: Misc\n    -\n      title: Logs\n      number: 9\n      command: tail -f /var/log/web_server.log\n\nThis configuration is identical to the last, except that it is a bit more generic.  The configuration named cool_site is now web_work_, and the working_directory now points to your generic projects directory.  When you use the ruby-screen command line utility, the first argument is usually going to refer to the name of one of your nested configurations, with any additional arguments being tacked on as directories relative to the *workingdirectory* specified in that configuration.\nIf you had a couple of web projects you are working on, like ~/web_projects/cool_project_, or ~/web_projects/legacywork, those specific projects can be launched using the generic web_work configuration by typing ruby-screen web_work cool_project and ruby-screen web_work legacy_work respectively.  Any new projects added to ~/web_projects can be launched by name through the web_work configuration.\nFinally, let\u2019s return to your cool site.  You have added some fancy new chat functionality to it, but that requires the chat server to be running during every development session.  Aside from the chat server, it\u2019s the same as all of your other web projects.\n\nstartup_message: off\ndefscrollback: 5000\n\nweb_work:\n  working_directory: ~/web_projects\n  windows:\n    -\n      title: Editor\n      command: vim .\n    -\n      title: Misc\n    -\n      title: Logs\n      number: 9\n      command: tail -f /var/log/web_server.log\n\n  cool_site:\n    relative_directory: cool_site\n    windows:\n      -\n        title: Chat Server\n        command: /bin/my_awesome_chat_server\n\nYou\u2019ve added on to the previous example and added a nested configuration, called cool_site.  It\u2019s under web_work_, and inherits all the Customizations and Windows defined above it, while defining a new window that will launch your chat server.  This nested configuration can be launched from the command line with *ruby-screen coolsite*.\nThe Configuration File\nRubyScreen looks for a file in your home directory named .ruby-screen.yml.  It must be a valid YAML file.  It can contain multiple elements that will be translated into a Screen-compatible plain text configuration file, depending on the command line arguments that are passed in when RubyScreen is launched.\nCustomizations\nThe simplest element, customizations consist of simple key/value pairs.  Valid customizations can be found in the \u201cCustomization\u201d section of the Screen manpage.\n\nstartup_message: off\ndefscrollback: 5000\n\nThis will result in a Screen configuration without the welcoming splash page, with a 5000 line scroll buffer.\n(YAML veterans may wonder that the \u2018off\u2019 value need not be quoted.  Pay no attention to the man behind the curtain.  It just doesn\u2019t.)\nWindows\nWindows in Screen are somewhat analogous to tabs in a browser.  You can use window definitions to specify the windows you want open at launch.  You can optionally title and number them, as well as giving them an initial command to execute at launch.\n\nwindows:\n  -\n    title: Miscellaneous\n  -\n    number: 0\n    title: First Window\n  -\n    number: 1\n    title: Processes\n    command: top\n\nThis would result in 3 windows at launch.  Window 0 would be named First Window with a fresh command prompt, window 1 would be named Processes and would be running the top command.  A third window, named Miscellaneous would have a fresh command prompt, and be assigned to the first available number by Screen.\nThe title, number, and command definitions are all optional, though you must supply one.   The value of the command is executed by Screen on launch, as-is.  If you decide that rm -FR is your command, it\u2019s not going to stop you.\nNested Configurations\nA nested configuration can be called by name from the ruby-screen command line utility.  They can contain the same elements as a top-level configuration.\n\nstartup_message: off\ndefscrollback: 5000\n\ngeneric:\n  windows:\n    -\n      title: Miscellaneous\n    -\n      number: 1\n      title: Other Window\n\n  specific:\n    defscrollback: 1000\n    windows:\n      -\n        number: 1\n        title: Nested Window\n\nNested configuration names are passed as the first argument to the ruby-screen command line utility.  When this happens, the programs processes the configuration from the highest level down through the hierarchy to the configuration you specified, merging customizations and windows as it goes.  Any customization keys or numbered windows that are duplicated deeper in the hierarchy will override those above them.\nCalling the nested configuration named specific above would use the Windows and Customizations specified in the top level and generic configurations, but would override the number of lines of scroll buffer and the name of Window 1.\nThere is no limit on how far you can nest, apart from your own sanity.\nPaths\nUse working_directory and relative_directory in instances where you will always want a certain configuration to launch with a specific working directory.  This is the equivalent to manually traversing to the intended directory before launching the Screen command.\n\nstartup_message: off\n\nweb_server_edit:\n  working_directory: /usr/local/my_web_server\n  windows:\n    -\n      name: Config\n      command: vim conf/my_web_server.conf\n    -\n      name: Log\n      command: tail -f server.log\n\nWhen running the web_server_edit configuration above, the commands will be executed in /usr/local/my_web_server.  Any new windows you open within Screen will also default to that directory.\nThe working directory can also begin with a tilde character to indicate your home directory.  ~/projects on a Linux system would translate to /home/your_username/projects_.  It is suggested that you use the tilde or a full path for your *workingdirectory* settings, so that RubyScreen can work as intended no matter where it is called from.\nThe relative_directory setting can be used in nested configurations and will be appended to the end of the current working directory.\nMisc\nBefore your configuration file is loaded by the YAML library it is processed by ERB, a Ruby templating system.  Information on its syntax is available here.  Any Ruby can be executed inside of ERB, so review any configuration files before executing.\nThanks\nThanks to the author of this blog posting, which got the ball rolling for me on launching Screen with predefined windows and commands.\nLicense\nCopyright \u00a9 2008\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining\na copy of this software and associated documentation files (the\n\u2018Software\u2019), to deal in the Software without restriction, including\nwithout limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish,\ndistribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to\npermit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to\nthe following conditions:\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be\nincluded in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \u2018AS IS\u2019, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,\nEXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF\nMERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.\nIN NO EVENT SHALL THE AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY\nCLAIM, DAMAGES OR OTHER LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT,\nTORT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM, OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE\nSOFTWARE OR THE USE OR OTHER DEALINGS IN THE SOFTWARE.",

Right now it also works on Mono, but\nthis is not guaranteed in the future. Also, the compiler is not self-hosting,\nwhich means it depends on the Lua interpreter, but as it's implemented in\na mix of Lua and C# it will be completely self-hosted when complete.\n\nThe compiler aims for completeness (implementing as much of Lua 5.1, including\nthe standard library, as possible) and speed (being faster than the Lua VM, and\napproaching LuaJIT). Also it should provide transparent interfacing between\nLua and the rest of the CLR (at least as good as what LuaInterface provides).\n\nThe current version is incomplete, and lacks most of the Lua standard library,\nas well as integration with the rest of the CLR. The design is also not fixed, and\nwill probably change in the near future.\n\nLuaCLR is free software.

    "Readme": "== Welcome to Rails\n\nRails is a web-application and persistence framework that includes everything\nneeded to create database-backed web-applications according to the\nModel-View-Control pattern of separation. This pattern splits the view (also\ncalled the presentation) into \"dumb\" templates that are primarily responsible\nfor inserting pre-built data in between HTML tags. The model contains the\n\"smart\" domain objects (such as Account, Product, Person, Post) that holds all\nthe business logic and knows how to persist themselves to a database. The\ncontroller handles the incoming requests (such as Save New Account, Update\nProduct, Show Post) by manipulating the model and directing data to the view.\n\nIn Rails, the model is handled by what's called an object-relational mapping\nlayer entitled Active Record. This layer allows you to present the data from\ndatabase rows as objects and embellish these data objects with business logic\nmethods. You can read more about Active Record in\nlink:files/vendor/rails/activerecord/README.html.\n\nThe controller and view are handled by the Action Pack, which handles both\nlayers by its two parts: Action View and Action Controller. These two layers\nare bundled in a single package due to their heavy interdependence. This is\nunlike the relationship between the Active Record and Action Pack that is much\nmore separate. Each of these packages can be used independently outside of\nRails.  You can read more about Action Pack in\nlink:files/vendor/rails/actionpack/README.html.\n\n\n== Getting Started\n\n1. At the command prompt, start a new Rails application using the <tt>rails</tt> command\n   and your application name. Ex: rails myapp\n   (If you've downloaded Rails in a complete tgz or zip, this step is already done)\n2. Change directory into myapp and start the web server: <tt>script/server</tt> (run with --help for options)\n3. Go to http://localhost:3000/ and get \"Welcome aboard: You\u2019re riding the Rails!\"\n4. Follow the guidelines to start developing your application\n\n\n== Web Servers\n\nBy default, Rails will try to use Mongrel and lighttpd if they are installed, otherwise\nRails will use WEBrick, the webserver that ships with Ruby. When you run script/server,\nRails will check if Mongrel exists, then lighttpd and finally fall back to WEBrick. This ensures\nthat you can always get up and running quickly.\n\nMongrel is a Ruby-based webserver with a C component (which requires compilation) that is\nsuitable for development and deployment of Rails applications. If you have Ruby Gems installed,\ngetting up and running with mongrel is as easy as: <tt>gem install mongrel</tt>.\nMore info at: http://mongrel.rubyforge.org\n\nIf Mongrel is not installed, Rails will look for lighttpd. It's considerably faster than\nMongrel and WEBrick and also suited for production use, but requires additional\ninstallation and currently only works well on OS X/Unix (Windows users are encouraged\nto start with Mongrel). We recommend version 1.4.11 and higher. You can download it from\nhttp://www.lighttpd.net.\n\nAnd finally, if neither Mongrel or lighttpd are installed, Rails will use the built-in Ruby\nweb server, WEBrick. WEBrick is a small Ruby web server suitable for development, but not\nfor production.\n\nBut of course its also possible to run Rails on any platform that supports FCGI.\nApache, LiteSpeed, IIS are just a few. For more information on FCGI,\nplease visit: http://wiki.rubyonrails.com/rails/pages/FastCGI\n\n\n== Debugging Rails\n\nSometimes your application goes wrong.  Fortunately there are a lot of tools that\nwill help you debug it and get it back on the rails.\n\nFirst area to check is the application log files.  Have \"tail -f\" commands running\non the server.log and development.log. Rails will automatically display debugging\nand runtime information to these files. Debugging info will also be shown in the\nbrowser on requests from 127.0.0.1.\n\nYou can also log your own messages directly into the log file from your code using\nthe Ruby logger class from inside your controllers. Example:\n\n  class WeblogController < ActionController::Base\n    def destroy\n      @weblog = Weblog.find(params[:id])\n      @weblog.destroy\n      logger.info(\"#{Time.now} Destroyed Weblog ID ##{@weblog.id}!\")\n    end\n  end\n\nThe result will be a message in your log file along the lines of:\n\n  Mon Oct 08 14:22:29 +1000 2007 Destroyed Weblog ID #1\n\nMore information on how to use the logger is at http://www.ruby-doc.org/core/\n\nAlso, Ruby documentation can be found at http://www.ruby-lang.org/ including:\n\n* The Learning Ruby (Pickaxe) Book: http://www.ruby-doc.org/docs/ProgrammingRuby/\n* Learn to Program: http://pine.fm/LearnToProgram/  (a beginners guide)\n\nThese two online (and free) books will bring you up to speed on the Ruby language\nand also on programming in general.\n\n\n== Debugger\n\nDebugger support is available through the debugger command when you start your Mongrel or\nWebrick server with --debugger. This means that you can break out of execution at any point\nin the code, investigate and change the model, AND then resume execution! Example:\n\n  class WeblogController < ActionController::Base\n    def index\n      @posts = Post.find(:all)\n      debugger\n    end\n  end\n\nSo the controller will accept the action, run the first line, then present you\nwith a IRB prompt in the server window. Here you can do things like:\n\n  >> @posts.inspect\n  => \"[#<Post:0x14a6be8 @attributes={\\\"title\\\"=>nil, \\\"body\\\"=>nil, \\\"id\\\"=>\\\"1\\\"}>,\n       #<Post:0x14a6620 @attributes={\\\"title\\\"=>\\\"Rails you know!\\\", \\\"body\\\"=>\\\"Only ten..\\\", \\\"id\\\"=>\\\"2\\\"}>]\"\n  >> @posts.first.title = \"hello from a debugger\"\n  => \"hello from a debugger\"\n\n...and even better is that you can examine how your runtime objects actually work:\n\n  >> f = @posts.first\n  => #<Post:0x13630c4 @attributes={\"title\"=>nil, \"body\"=>nil, \"id\"=>\"1\"}>\n  >> f.\n  Display all 152 possibilities? (y or n)\n\nFinally, when you're ready to resume execution, you enter \"cont\"\n\n\n== Console\n\nYou can interact with the domain model by starting the console through <tt>script/console</tt>.\nHere you'll have all parts of the application configured, just like it is when the\napplication is running. You can inspect domain models, change values, and save to the\ndatabase. Starting the script without arguments will launch it in the development environment.\nPassing an argument will specify a different environment, like <tt>script/console production</tt>.\n\nTo reload your controllers and models after launching the console run <tt>reload!</tt>\n\n\n== Description of Contents\n\napp\n  Holds all the code that's specific to this particular application.\n\napp/controllers\n  Holds controllers that should be named like weblogs_controller.rb for\n  automated URL mapping. All controllers should descend from ApplicationController\n  which itself descends from ActionController::Base.\n\napp/models\n  Holds models that should be named like post.rb.\n  Most models will descend from ActiveRecord::Base.\n\napp/views\n  Holds the template files for the view that should be named like\n  weblogs/index.erb for the WeblogsController#index action. All views use eRuby\n  syntax.\n\napp/views/layouts\n  Holds the template files for layouts to be used with views. This models the common\n  header/footer method of wrapping views. In your views, define a layout using the\n  <tt>layout :default</tt> and create a file named default.erb. Inside default.erb,\n  call <% yield %> to render the view using this layout.\n\napp/helpers\n  Holds view helpers that should be named like weblogs_helper.rb. These are generated\n  for you automatically when using script/generate for controllers. Helpers can be used to\n  wrap functionality for your views into methods.\n\nconfig\n  Configuration files for the Rails environment, the routing map, the database, and other dependencies.\n\ndb\n  Contains the database schema in schema.rb.  db/migrate contains all\n  the sequence of Migrations for your schema.\n\ndoc\n  This directory is where your application documentation will be stored when generated\n  using <tt>rake doc:app</tt>\n\nlib\n  Application specific libraries. Basically, any kind of custom code that doesn't\n  belong under controllers, models, or helpers. This directory is in the load path.\n\npublic\n  The directory available for the web server. Contains subdirectories for images, stylesheets,\n  and javascripts. Also contains the dispatchers and the default HTML files. This should be\n  set as the DOCUMENT_ROOT of your web server.\n\nscript\n  Helper scripts for automation and generation.\n\ntest\n  Unit and functional tests along with fixtures. When using the script/generate scripts, template\n  test files will be generated for you and placed in this directory.\n\nvendor\n  External libraries that the application depends on. Also includes the plugins subdirectory.\n  This directory is in the load path.\n\n",

This is a CSS framework designed to \ncut down on your CSS development time. It gives you a solid \nfoundation to build your own CSS on. Here are some of the \nfeatures BP provides out-of-the-box:\n\n* An easily customizable grid\n* Sensible default typography\n* A typographic baseline\n* Perfected browser CSS reset\n* A stylesheet for printing\n* Absolutely no bloat!\n\n\nSetup instructions\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\nHere's how you set up Blueprint on your site. \n\n1) Upload the \"blueprint\" folder in this folder to your server, \n   and place it in whatever folder you'd like. A good choice \n   would be your CSS folder.\n\n2) Add the following three lines to every <head> section of your\n   site. Make sure the three href paths are correct (here, BP is in my CSS folder):\n\n   <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"css/blueprint/screen.css\" type=\"text/css\" media=\"screen, projection\">\n   <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"css/blueprint/print.css\" type=\"text/css\" media=\"print\">   \n   <!--[if IE]><link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"css/blueprint/lib/ie.css\" type=\"text/css\" media=\"screen, projection\"><![endif]-->\n\n3) See screen.css for further configuration options, including \n   advanced functionality through plugins.\n\n4) To use the compressed version on a live site, edit the href \n   paths above to point to the blueprint/compressed directory, \n   where you'll find compressed versions of screen.css and print.css.    \n\n\nHow to use Blueprint\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\nHere's a quick primer on how to use BP:\nhttp://code.google.com/p/blueprintcss/wiki/Tutorial\n\nEach CSS file is also heavily commented, so you'll \nlearn a lot by reading through them.\n\n\nFiles in Blueprint\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe framework has a few files you should check out. Every file\ncontains lots of (hopefully) clarifying comments.\n\n\nMain files:\n\n* blueprint/screen.css\n  This is the main file of the framework. It imports other CSS \n  files from the \"lib\" directory, and should be included on \n  every page. We also call it the the configuration file, \n  although you don't actually have to modify it.\n\n* blueprint/print.css\n  This file sets some default print rules, so that printed versions\n  of your site looks better than they usually would. It should be\n  included on every page.\n\n\nCore files:\n\n* blueprint/lib/grid.css\n  This file sets up the grid (it's true). It has a lot of classes\n  you apply to divs to set up any sort of column-based grid.\n\n* blueprint/lib/typography.css\n  This file sets some default typography. It also has a few\n  methods for some really fancy stuff to do with your text.\n\n* blueprint/lib/reset.css\n  This file resets CSS values that browsers tend to set for you.\n\n* blueprint/compressed/screen.css & \n  blueprint/compressed/print.css\n  A compressed version of the core and print files. Use this on \n  every live site. Use the link tags in the HTML to include these.\n\n* blueprint/lib/ie.css\n  Contains every hack for Internet Explorer,so that our core \n  files stay sweet and valid.\n\n\nOther:\n\n* blueprint/plugins/\n  Contains additional functionality in the form of simple plugins\n  for Blueprint. See individual readme files in the directory\n  of each plugin for further instructions.\n\n* tests/\n  Contains html files which tests most aspects of Blueprint.\n  Open tests/index.html for further instructions.\n\n\nCredits\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\nMany parts of BP are directly inspired by other peoples work. \nYou may thank them for their brilliance.

    "Readme": "\nHaml and Sass\nHaml and Sass are templating engines for the two most common types of\ndocuments on the web: HTML and CSS, respectively. They are designed to make\nit both easier and more pleasant to code HTML and CSS documents, by\neliminating redundancy, reflecting the underlying structure that the\ndocument represents, and providing elegant, easily understandable, and\npowerful syntax.\nUsing\nThere are several ways to use Haml and Sass. They can be used as a plugins\nfor Rails or Merb, or embedded on their own in other applications. The\nfirst step of all of these is to install the Haml gem:\ngem install haml\nTo install Haml and Sass as a Rails plugin, just run haml --rails\npath/to/rails/app and both Haml and Sass will be installed. Views with\nthe .haml (or .html.haml for edge) extension will\nautomatically use Haml. Sass is a little more complicated; .sass\nfiles should be placed in public/stylesheets/sass, where they'll be\nautomatically compiled to corresponding CSS files in public/stylesheets\nwhen needed (the Sass template directory is customizable\u2026 see the Sass\nmodule docs for details).\nFor Merb, .html.haml views will work without any further\nmodification. To enable Sass, you also need to add it add a dependency. To\ndo so, just add\ndependency \"haml\"\nto config/dependencies.rb. Then it'll work just like it does in Rails.\nTo use Haml and Sass programatically, check out the RDocs for the Haml and\nSass modules.\nFormatting\nHaml\nThe most basic element of Haml is a shorthand for creating HTML tags:\n%tagname{ :attr1 => 'value1', :attr2 => 'value2' } Contents\nNo end-tag is needed; Haml handles that automatically. Adding\nclass and id attributes is even easier. Haml uses the\nsame syntax as the CSS that styles the document:\n%tagname#id.class\nIn fact, when you're using the <div> tag, it becomes\neven easier. Because <div> is such a common\nelement, a tag without a name defaults to a div. So\n#foo Hello!\nbecomes\n<div id='foo'>Hello!</div>\nHaml uses indentation to bring the individual elements to represent the\nHTML structure. A tag's children are indented beneath than the parent\ntag. Again, a closing tag is automatically added. For example:\n%ul\n  %li Salt\n  %li Pepper\nbecomes:\n<ul>\n  <li>Salt</li>\n  <li>Pepper</li>\n</ul>\nYou can also put plain text as a child of an element:\n%p\n  Hello,\n  World!\nIt's even possible to embed Ruby code into Haml documents. An equals\nsign, =, will output the result of the code. A hyphen, -,\nwill run the code but not output the result. You can even use control\nstatements like if and while:\n%p\n  Date/Time:\n  - now = DateTime.now\n  %strong= now\n  - if now > DateTime.parse(\"December 31, 2006\")\n    = \"Happy new \" + \"year!\"\nHaml provides far more tools than those presented here. Check out the\nreference documentation in the Haml module.\nSass\nAt its most basic, Sass is just another way of writing CSS. Although\nit's very much like normal CSS, the basic syntax offers a few helpful\nfeatures: tabulation indicates the attributes in a rule, rather than\nnon-DRY brackets; and newlines indicate the end of an attribute, rather\nthan a semicolon. For example:\n#main\n  :background-color #f00\n  :width 98%\nbecomes:\n#main {\n  background-color: #f00;\n  width: 98% }\nHowever, Sass provides much more than a way to make CSS look nice. In CSS,\nit's important to have accurate selectors, so your styles don't\njust apply to everything. However, in order to do this, you need to use\nnested element selectors. These get very ugly very quickly. I'm sure\neveryone's had to write something like \u201c#main .sidebar .top p h1 a\u201d,\nfollowed by \u201c#main .sidebar .top p h1 a:visited\u201d and \u201c#main .sidebar .top p\nh1 a:hover\u201d. Well, Sass gets rid of that. Like Haml, it uses indentation to\nindicate the structure of the document. So, what was:\n#main {\n  width: 90%;\n}\n#main p {\n  border-style: solid;\n  border-width: 1px;\n  border-color: #00f;\n}\n#main p a {\n  text-decoration: none;\n  font-weight: bold;\n}\n#main p a:hover {\n  text-decoration: underline;\n}\nbecomes:\n#main\n  :width 90%\n  p\n    :border-style solid\n    :border-width 1px\n    :border-color #00f\n    a\n      :text-decoration none\n      :font-weight bold\n    a:hover\n      :text-decoration underline\nPretty nice, no? Well, it gets better. One of the main complaints against\nCSS is that it doesn't allow constants. What if have a color or a width\nyou re-use all the time? In CSS, you just have to re-type it each time,\nwhich is a nightmare when you decide to change it later. Not so for Sass!\nYou can use the \u201c!\u201d character to set constants. Then, if you put \u201c=\u201d after\nyour attribute name, you can set it to a constant. For example:\n!note_bg= #55aaff\n\n#main\n  :width 70%\n  .note\n    :background-color= !note_bg\n  p\n    :width 5em\n    :background-color= !note_bg\nbecomes:\n#main {\n  width: 70%; }\n  #main .note {\n    background-color: #55aaff; }\n  #main p {\n    width: 5em;\n    background-color: #55aaff; }\nYou can even do simple arithmetic operations with constants, adding numbers\nand even colors together:\n!main_bg= #46ar12\n!main_width= 40em\n\n#main\n  :background-color= !main_bg\n  :width= !main_width\n  .sidebar\n    :background-color= !main_bg + #333333\n    :width= !main_width - 25em\nbecomes:\n#main {\n  background-color: #46a312;\n  width: 40em; }\n  #main .sidebar {\n    background-color: #79d645;\n    width: 15em; }\nTaking the idea of constants a bit further are mixins. These let you group\nwhole swathes of CSS attributes into a single directive and then include\nthose anywhere you want:\n=blue-border\n  :border\n    :color blue\n    :width 2px\n    :style dotted\n\n.comment\n  +blue-border\n  :padding 2px\n  :margin 10px 0\n\n.reply\n  +blue-border\nbecomes:\n.comment {\n  border-color: blue;\n  border-width: 2px;\n  border-style: dotted;\n  padding: 2px;\n  margin: 10px 0;\n}\n\n.reply {\n  border-color: blue;\n  border-width: 2px;\n  border-style: dotted;\n}\nA comprehensive list of features is in the documentation for the Sass\nmodule.\nIndentation\nIndentation can be made up of one or more tabs or spaces. However,\nindentation must be consistent within a given document. Hard tabs and\nspaces can't be mixed, and the same number of tabs or spaces must be\nused throughout.\nExecutables\nThe Haml gem includes several executables that are useful for dealing with\nHaml and Sass from the command line.\nhaml\nThe haml executable transforms a source Haml file into HTML. See\nhaml --help for further information and options.\nsass\nThe sass executable transforms a source Sass file into CSS. See\nsass --help for further information and options.\nhtml2haml\nThe html2haml executable attempts to transform HTML, optionally\nwith ERB markup, into Haml code. Since HTML is so variable, this\ntransformation is not always perfect; it's a good idea to have a human\ncheck the output of this tool. See html2haml --help for further\ninformation and options.\ncss2sass\nThe css2sass executable attempts to transform CSS into Sass code.\nThis transformation attempts to use Sass nesting where possible. See\ncss2sass --help for further information and options.\nAuthors\nHaml and Sass are designed by Hampton Catlin (hcatlin) and he is the author\nof the original implementation. However, Hampton doesn't even know his\nway around the code anymore and mostly just concentrates on the language\nissues. Hampton lives in Toronto, Ontario (though he's an American by\nbirth) and is a partner at Unspace Interactive.\nNathan Weizenbaum is the primary maintainer and architect of the \u201cmodern\u201d\nRuby implementation of Haml. His hard work has kept the project alive by\nendlessly answering forum posts, fixing bugs, refactoring, finding speed\nimprovements, writing documentation, implementing new features, and getting\nHampton coffee (a fitting task for a boy-genius). Nathan lives in Seattle,\nWashington and while not being a student at University of Washington he\nconsults for Unspace Interactive and Microsoft.\nIf you use this software, you must pay Hampton a compliment. And buy Nathan\nsome jelly beans. Maybe pet a kitten. Yeah. Pet that kitty.\nSome of the work on Haml was supported by Unspace Interactive.\nBeyond that, the implementation is licensed under the MIT License. Ok,\nfine, I guess that means compliments aren't required.\n",

When creating code, it is much faster to be able to place tests immediately after the code you are writing.  After the code has been written, it may be a good idea to move it to another file.\n\nQuicktest is designed to support quick tests in a framework agnostic way.  Currently, only an rspec testrunner is available, but it is trivial to write one for another testing framework.\n\nQuicktest uses method tracing to know the method you are testing. By default the output of a failed test will show the object and method name.\n\n== Install\ngem install quicktest\n\n== Source\n=== browser\nhttp://github.com/gregwebs/quicktest/tree/master\n\n=== repository\ngit clone git://github.com/gregwebs/quicktest.git\n\n== Homepage\nhttp://gregweber.info/projects/quicktest.html\n\n== RDoc documentation\nincluded with the gem\n\n== Important Notes\n- def quicktest will instantiate an object for the class you are testing, which gives a convenient referenct to self in the quicktest method.  However, it calls new() without any parameters.  If you need parameters for new(), you will have to use def self.quicktest and call new() yourself\n\n== Configuration\n- when testing module instance methods, the module is included into an anonymous class.  By default, that class inherits from Object.  To change this you must define an object that the module will be included into by defining the following in the module:\n\n  def self.quicktest_include_into; String end\n\n- you can change the testing method name from quicktest to something else using the command line option\n\n  --quicktest better_testing_name\n\n== TroubleShooting\n- quicktest methods not working properly? if the class (or one of its ancestors) is overriding method tracing then including QuickTest::Tracer will fix it, but you should also fix the class or its ancestor.\n\n== Unimportant Notes\n=== production performance\nleaving test code in with your production code is not necessarily a good idea, but you can put\n\n  remove_method :quicktest\n\nat the bottom of a class to completely remove the quicktest method\n\n=== rationals\n* tests for scripts\nDefinitely very useful for one file scripts, or any type of code that does not have a well established project home where the tests will be.  You can distribute the tests with script so that anyone who wants to modify it can also modify the tests instead of assuming the original author did not write any.\nYou can have a flow of development where a 'quick and dirty' script becomes well tested.  Here is a shell function that tests the file before every run.\n  function test_run () { quickspec $1 && $1 }\n* documentation\nTests are a form of documentation.  It can be argued that it is better to have all documentation include in the source\n\n* efficient TDD and prototyping\nWhen writing fresh code you now have the possibility to be directly next to the code under test without having to switch back and forth between files.  When you are done writing the new code, you can easily pull all the quicktest methods out and into a spec file.\n\n\n=== Origins\nQuicktest came out of my dabbling in the D programming language, which allows you to place testing blocks inline with your source code\n  unittest{\n   ...\n  }\n\nNormally, these blocks are ignored, but if you compile with a different switch, they are linked in and ran at the beginning of your program.\nOriginally, I made an exact copy of this, but among other things, it requires the placement of a line like\n  (def unittest;end) if not defined? unittest\nat the beginning of the file.  It would be nice if Ruby had a similar construct built in to the language.\n\n=== implementation\nQuicktest uses method tracing to know the method you are testing.  For the object under test, testing methods are included into it, and then the test is run.\n\n\n=end rdoc\n\n",

Barry Trager was key\nto the technical direction of the project. Scratchpad developed over a\n20 year stretch and was basically considered as a research platform\nfor developing new ideas in computational mathematics. In the 1990s,\nas IBM's fortunes slid, the Scratchpad project was renamed to Axiom,\nsold to the Numerical Algorithms Group (NAG) in England and became a\ncommercial system.  As part of the Scratchpad project at IBM in\nYorktown I worked on all aspects of the system and eventually helped\ntransfer the product to NAG. For a variety of reasons it never became\na financial success and NAG withdrew it from the market in October,\n2001.\n\nNAG agreed to release Axiom as free software. The basic motivation was\nthat Axiom represents something different from other programs in a lot\nof ways. Primarily because of its foundation in mathematics the Axiom\nsystem will potentially be useful 30 years from now.  In its current\nstate it represents about 30 years and 300 man-years of research\nwork. To strive to keep such a large collection of knowledge alive\nseems a worthwhile goal.\n\nHowever, keeping Axiom alive means more than just taking the source\ncode and dumping it onto a public server. There are a lot of things\nabout the system that need to change if it is going to survive and\nthrive for the next 30 years.\n\nThe system is complex and difficult to build. There are few people who\nknow how it is structured and why it is structured that way. Somehow\nit needs to be documented deeply so others can contribute.\n\nThe mathematics is difficult. Unlike other free software you can't\njust reach for the old saying ``read the source code''.  The source\ncode is plain, clear and about as close to the mathematical theory as\nis practical. Unfortunately the mathematical theory is enshrined in\nsome research library where few people will have access. Somehow this\nmust change. The research work, the mathematics, the published papers,\nand the source code have all got to be kept together for the next\ngeneration to read, understand and modify.\n\nThe mathematics is narrow and very focused. This was due to the fact\nthat, while Axiom is a great research platform, we only had a limited\nnumber of visitors at IBM Research. So there is very little in the way\nof, say, infinite group theory in Axiom. We can add it. Doing so will\nshow up shortcomings in the system.  For example, how do you represent\nan infinite object? There are many possible representations and they\ndepend on your goals. The system will have to change, expand, and,\nhopefully, become cleaner as more thought is applied. Scratchpad\nchanged continuously while it was being used for research and we\nexpect Axiom to do the same.\n\nThe language (spad) is designed to let you write algorithms that are\nvery close to the mathematics. However, the algorithms as presented in\nthe current system have never been shown or proven (an important\ndistinction) to be correct.  It is vital that we undertake the huge\neffort of verifying and validating the code. How else can we trust the\nresults and of what use is a system this complex without trust?\nSomehow we have to extend the system to integrate program proof\ntechniques.  That is, we have to make computational mathematics hold\nto the same standard as the rest of mathematics.\n\nAll of which seems to integrate into a requirement for better\ndocumentation. The key change which developers of Axiom will find with\nthis version is that the documentation is primary and the code is\nsecondary. Taking direction from Knuth and Dijkstra the system is now\nin a literate programming style. The hope is that the next generation\nof developers and users will be able to understand, maintain and\nextend the system gracefully. And that eventually papers submitted to\njournals (an Axiom Journal?) will be easily imported into the system\nwith their running code made available automatically.\n\nThere is no guarantee that this attempt to change the culture of\ncomputational mathematicians is going to succeed. But it is our firm\nbelief that current systems have reached a complexity plateau and we\nneed to find new techniques to push the envelope.\n\nIn general, we need to consider changes to the system with a 30 year\nhorizon rather than the current write-ship-debug mentality of software\ndevelopment. This is, after all, mathematics, the queen of the\nsciences. It deserves all of the time, talent and attention we can\nbring to bear on the subject.\n\nTim Daly -- September 3, 2002\n\nContributions\n\nAll of these people have, in some way or other, been associated with\nScratchpad and Axiom. If you contribute, add your name.  The names are\nin alphabetical order as we make no attempt to quantify the relative\nmerit of the contributions.\n\nIn books/bookvol5.pamphlet is a variable called credits\nwhich contains this list.

Yet our practice in\n   programming documentation violates our own teaching. We typically\n   attempt to maintain a machine-readable form of a program and an\n   independent set of human-readable documentation, consisting of prose\n   and flowcharts ... The solution, I think, is to merge the files, to\n   incorporate the documentation in the source program.\"\n\n\n   \"A common fallacy is to assume authors of incomprehensilbe code\n    will somehow be able to express themselves lucidly and clearly\n    in comments.\" -- Kevlin Henney\n\n   \"A programmer who cannot explain their ideas clearly in natural\n    language is incapable of writing readable code.\" -- Tim Daly\n\nAs you can already see from this document the whole of the Axiom\neffort is structured around literate programs. Every directory has a\nMakefile.pamphlet file which explains details of that directory. The\nwhole source tree hangs from the Makefile tree. (Some of the\nMakefile.pamphlet files contain only text if executable code is not\nneeded).  Every source file is embedded in a pamphlet file.\n\nWhich begs the question: ``What is a pamphlet file?''.  Basically it\nis a tex document with some additional markup tags that surround\nsource code. Pamphlet files are intended to document one particular\nsubject. Pamphlet files can be later combined into ``booklet'' files\nas one would embed chapters into books.\n\nWhich begs the question: ``Why bother with pamphlet files?''.  Clearly\nyou didn't read the philosophy rant above. In more detail there have\nbeen two traditional methods of documenting source code. The first is\nto sprinkle random comments into the code.  This suffers from the\nproblem that the comments assume you already understand the purpose of\nthe code and why an enlightened comment like ``This oughta work'' is\nperfectly clear and compelling. The second method is to write a\ndocument as a separate file. They get written half-heartedly because\nthe lack of source code allows you to skip over explaining ugly\nimplementation details (where all of the real confusion lies). This\nform of documentation never gets updated and gradually becomes\nuninteresting history.\n\nPamphlet files overcome neither of these limitations if you don't make\nthe effort to do it right. Ask yourself the question ``What would\nKnuth do?'' or ``Will this be clear 30 years from now?''.\n\nWhich begs the question: ``Why go to all this trouble?''.  Because\nyou're having a conversation with people who are far removed from you\nin time, space, and understanding.  Because someone else will have to\nmaintain your code.  Because you are part of a community of\nmathematicians who hold you to high standards. Because if you can't\nexplain it clearly maybe YOU don't understand it or it isn't as clear\nas you think it is.\n\nLets imagine that we'd like to receive a pamphlet file from a\ncolleague. It contains a new theory and spiffy new algorithm.  We'd\nlike to be able to put the pamphlet file into the system and have\neverything magically happen to integrate the new pamphlet into the\nsystem. What would that imply? Well, lets assume that the pamphlet\nfile has certain required sections. We'd like to get more than the\ntechnical paper and the code. We'd also like to see the help\ninformation, test cases, example code, cross-references to other\npamphlets that would get automatically included, have the proof\navailable and automatically checkable, etc. In the best of all\npossible worlds we have a front-end system that knows nothing except\nhow to deconstruct and integrate properly formed pamphlet files. If\nthis were true we could be sure that all of the mathematics is\ndocumented and external to the system. There are no ``rabbits'' (as\nDijkstra called surprises or special knowledge) that we pull out of\nour hat. Conceptually, given an underlying Lisp system, it is clear we\ncan built such a system.\n\nThe General Directory Structure\n\nThe Top Level directory structure contains 7 directories which are\nexplained in detail below. Three of the directories (license, zips,\nand lsp) are not part of the essential core of Axiom.\n\nThe other four directories (src, int, obj, and mnt) comprise the\nsystem build environment. Each directory has a specific purpose. Lets\nlook at the essential directories first.\n\n$AXIOM\n  license\n  lsp\n    GCL\n  src\n    include\n    lib\n    scripts\n  int\n    doc\n  obj\n    tmp\n    noweb\n    SYS=(linux,...)\n  mnt\n    SYS=(linux,...)\n  zips\n\nThe src directory consists of human-written, system-independent\ncode. You can copy this directory (and the top-level makefiles) and\nhave a complete build system. Nothing in this directory is ever\nchanged by the Makefiles and it can be mounted in a read-only fashion\nduring the build process. An example file would be the lisp source\nfiles.\n\nThe int directory consists of machine-generated, system-independent\ncode. Consider this directory as a cache. Nothing in this directory is\nnecessary for a clean system build but once the build completes the\ninformation in this directory can significantly shorten rebuilds.\nSince this information is system-independent we can use the cache no\nmatter what architecture we target. An example file would be the dvi\nfiles generated from the tex sources.\n\nThe obj directory consists of machine-generated, system-dependent\ncode. This directory is \"scratch\" space for the compiler and other\ntools. Nothing in this directory is useful once the system is\nbuilt. An example file would be the .o files from the C compiler.\n\nThe mnt directory consists of machine-generated, system-dependent code\nthat will comprise the \"shipped system\". You can copy this directory\nand have a complete, running Axiom system. If the end user will see it\nor need it in any way it belongs here. Executables are generally built\nin obj and moved here. Example files would be the final executable\nimages, the input files, etc.\n\nThe four directories above make it possible to do a system build for\none system (say, a linux system) which will fill in the int\nsubdirectory. Then you can NFS mount the src and int directories\nread-only on a Solaris machine and do a solaris system build.  The\noriginal Axiom could build across many different architectures,\ncompilers, and operating systems.\n\nThe license directory\n\nThe license directory collects all of the licenses for material that\nis included in this distribution. Source files contain a line that\nrefers to one of these license files. Some people are of the belief\nthat including the full license text in every source file magically\nstrengthens the license but this is not so.  Imagine including the\nfull text of the copyright at the beginning of every section of a book.\n\nThe LICENSE.AXIOM file is a Modified BSD-style license that covers all\nof the files released as part of this distribution except as noted in\nparticular files. Copyright information that might have shown up in\nsource files that were released from NAG are also collected here and\nnoted at the top of the files they cover.\n\nThe zips directory\n\nThe zips directory contains particular distributions of\nnetwork-available software that is known to work with this release of\nAxiom. Newer versions may work and, if so, should be added to this\ndirectory. The makefiles that handle these files will unpack them into\nthe correct locations in the src directory tree. These files exist to\nincrease the stability of the distribution so we can guarantee that\nthe code works. We encourage testing the latest distributions so that\nwe can remain with the leading edge and give feedback to the\nindividual package developers if problems arise.\n\nThe lsp directory\n\nAxiom lives on top of Common Lisp, specifically Gnu Common Lisp (GCL)\n\nSteps to build Axiom\n\nThe Initial Distribution files\n\nThe initial distribution contains several top level files. These are:\n\n1) Makefile.pamphlet\n     This is the noweb source for the Makefile file. All changes to\n     the Makefile should occur here and the\n\n3) Makefile This is the actual Makefile that will create Axiom. \n\nIn general the distribution will contain the pamphlet files for each\nsource file and the source file itself. Modifications should be made\nand explained in the pamphlet files. The document command should be\nrun to rebuild the source file and the dvi file.\n\nSteps in the build process\n\nThe sequence of steps necessary to build a clean Axiom is simply:\n\n  export AXIOM=(path-including-this-directory)/mnt/SYSNAME\n  export PATH=$AXIOM/bin:$PATH\n  make\n\nIf this fails check the FAQ for possible problems and their fixes.\n\n\n",

Ubuntu Linux, Debian and Mac OS X are tested.  To install\ndependencies on Ubuntu or Debian, type:\n\n$ sudo aptitude install lua5.1 liblua5.1-0-dev\n\nTo build and install Gazelle, type:\n\n$ make\n$ make install\n\nYou can change the installation location as follows:\n\n$ make PREFIX=/usr/local\n$ make install PREFIX=/usr/local DESTDIR=/tmp\n\nThis will install Gazelle into /tmp/usr/local.\n\nTo build the documentation, you need to have asciidoc installed, as well\nas graphviz if you want to see the graphics. \n\n$ make doc\n\nAlternatively you can just read the manual on the Gazelle website.\n\nROADMAP OF THE SOURCE\n=====================\n\ncompiler/\n  what parses the grammar, turns it into state machines, and dumps into bytcode\ncompiler/bootstrap\n  compiler code that will not be needed once Gazelle is self-hosting\nlang_ext/\n  wrappers around the C runtime, for high-level languages (currently only Lua)\nruntime/\n  the tiny, fast, small-memory-footprint C runtime that actually does the parsing\nruntime/include\n  public header files for the runtime.\nsketches/\n  code that is either half-written or for debugging-only\ntests/\n  unit tests (not very many at the moment)\nutilities/\n  command-line utilities for doing useful things\n\nCONTACT\n=======\n\nFor questions, comments, etc. please post to the gazelle-users group.

    "Readme": "== Welcome to Rails\n\nRails is a web-application and persistence framework that includes everything\nneeded to create database-backed web-applications according to the\nModel-View-Control pattern of separation. This pattern splits the view (also\ncalled the presentation) into \"dumb\" templates that are primarily responsible\nfor inserting pre-built data in between HTML tags. The model contains the\n\"smart\" domain objects (such as Account, Product, Person, Post) that holds all\nthe business logic and knows how to persist themselves to a database. The\ncontroller handles the incoming requests (such as Save New Account, Update\nProduct, Show Post) by manipulating the model and directing data to the view.\n\nIn Rails, the model is handled by what's called an object-relational mapping\nlayer entitled Active Record. This layer allows you to present the data from\ndatabase rows as objects and embellish these data objects with business logic\nmethods. You can read more about Active Record in\nlink:files/vendor/rails/activerecord/README.html.\n\nThe controller and view are handled by the Action Pack, which handles both\nlayers by its two parts: Action View and Action Controller. These two layers\nare bundled in a single package due to their heavy interdependence. This is\nunlike the relationship between the Active Record and Action Pack that is much\nmore separate. Each of these packages can be used independently outside of\nRails.  You can read more about Action Pack in\nlink:files/vendor/rails/actionpack/README.html.\n\n\n== Getting Started\n\n1. At the command prompt, start a new Rails application using the <tt>rails</tt> command\n   and your application name. Ex: rails myapp\n   (If you've downloaded Rails in a complete tgz or zip, this step is already done)\n2. Change directory into myapp and start the web server: <tt>script/server</tt> (run with --help for options)\n3. Go to http://localhost:3000/ and get \"Welcome aboard: You\u2019re riding the Rails!\"\n4. Follow the guidelines to start developing your application\n\n\n== Web Servers\n\nBy default, Rails will try to use Mongrel and lighttpd if they are installed, otherwise\nRails will use WEBrick, the webserver that ships with Ruby. When you run script/server,\nRails will check if Mongrel exists, then lighttpd and finally fall back to WEBrick. This ensures\nthat you can always get up and running quickly.\n\nMongrel is a Ruby-based webserver with a C component (which requires compilation) that is\nsuitable for development and deployment of Rails applications. If you have Ruby Gems installed,\ngetting up and running with mongrel is as easy as: <tt>gem install mongrel</tt>.\nMore info at: http://mongrel.rubyforge.org\n\nIf Mongrel is not installed, Rails will look for lighttpd. It's considerably faster than\nMongrel and WEBrick and also suited for production use, but requires additional\ninstallation and currently only works well on OS X/Unix (Windows users are encouraged\nto start with Mongrel). We recommend version 1.4.11 and higher. You can download it from\nhttp://www.lighttpd.net.\n\nAnd finally, if neither Mongrel or lighttpd are installed, Rails will use the built-in Ruby\nweb server, WEBrick. WEBrick is a small Ruby web server suitable for development, but not\nfor production.\n\nBut of course its also possible to run Rails on any platform that supports FCGI.\nApache, LiteSpeed, IIS are just a few. For more information on FCGI,\nplease visit: http://wiki.rubyonrails.com/rails/pages/FastCGI\n\n\n== Debugging Rails\n\nSometimes your application goes wrong.  Fortunately there are a lot of tools that\nwill help you debug it and get it back on the rails.\n\nFirst area to check is the application log files.  Have \"tail -f\" commands running\non the server.log and development.log. Rails will automatically display debugging\nand runtime information to these files. Debugging info will also be shown in the\nbrowser on requests from 127.0.0.1.\n\nYou can also log your own messages directly into the log file from your code using\nthe Ruby logger class from inside your controllers. Example:\n\n  class WeblogController < ActionController::Base\n    def destroy\n      @weblog = Weblog.find(params[:id])\n      @weblog.destroy\n      logger.info(\"#{Time.now} Destroyed Weblog ID ##{@weblog.id}!\")\n    end\n  end\n\nThe result will be a message in your log file along the lines of:\n\n  Mon Oct 08 14:22:29 +1000 2007 Destroyed Weblog ID #1\n\nMore information on how to use the logger is at http://www.ruby-doc.org/core/\n\nAlso, Ruby documentation can be found at http://www.ruby-lang.org/ including:\n\n* The Learning Ruby (Pickaxe) Book: http://www.ruby-doc.org/docs/ProgrammingRuby/\n* Learn to Program: http://pine.fm/LearnToProgram/  (a beginners guide)\n\nThese two online (and free) books will bring you up to speed on the Ruby language\nand also on programming in general.\n\n\n== Debugger\n\nDebugger support is available through the debugger command when you start your Mongrel or\nWebrick server with --debugger. This means that you can break out of execution at any point\nin the code, investigate and change the model, AND then resume execution! Example:\n\n  class WeblogController < ActionController::Base\n    def index\n      @posts = Post.find(:all)\n      debugger\n    end\n  end\n\nSo the controller will accept the action, run the first line, then present you\nwith a IRB prompt in the server window. Here you can do things like:\n\n  >> @posts.inspect\n  => \"[#<Post:0x14a6be8 @attributes={\\\"title\\\"=>nil, \\\"body\\\"=>nil, \\\"id\\\"=>\\\"1\\\"}>,\n       #<Post:0x14a6620 @attributes={\\\"title\\\"=>\\\"Rails you know!\\\", \\\"body\\\"=>\\\"Only ten..\\\", \\\"id\\\"=>\\\"2\\\"}>]\"\n  >> @posts.first.title = \"hello from a debugger\"\n  => \"hello from a debugger\"\n\n...and even better is that you can examine how your runtime objects actually work:\n\n  >> f = @posts.first\n  => #<Post:0x13630c4 @attributes={\"title\"=>nil, \"body\"=>nil, \"id\"=>\"1\"}>\n  >> f.\n  Display all 152 possibilities? (y or n)\n\nFinally, when you're ready to resume execution, you enter \"cont\"\n\n\n== Console\n\nYou can interact with the domain model by starting the console through <tt>script/console</tt>.\nHere you'll have all parts of the application configured, just like it is when the\napplication is running. You can inspect domain models, change values, and save to the\ndatabase. Starting the script without arguments will launch it in the development environment.\nPassing an argument will specify a different environment, like <tt>script/console production</tt>.\n\nTo reload your controllers and models after launching the console run <tt>reload!</tt>\n\n\n== Description of Contents\n\napp\n  Holds all the code that's specific to this particular application.\n\napp/controllers\n  Holds controllers that should be named like weblogs_controller.rb for\n  automated URL mapping. All controllers should descend from ApplicationController\n  which itself descends from ActionController::Base.\n\napp/models\n  Holds models that should be named like post.rb.\n  Most models will descend from ActiveRecord::Base.\n\napp/views\n  Holds the template files for the view that should be named like\n  weblogs/index.erb for the WeblogsController#index action. All views use eRuby\n  syntax.\n\napp/views/layouts\n  Holds the template files for layouts to be used with views. This models the common\n  header/footer method of wrapping views. In your views, define a layout using the\n  <tt>layout :default</tt> and create a file named default.erb. Inside default.erb,\n  call <% yield %> to render the view using this layout.\n\napp/helpers\n  Holds view helpers that should be named like weblogs_helper.rb. These are generated\n  for you automatically when using script/generate for controllers. Helpers can be used to\n  wrap functionality for your views into methods.\n\nconfig\n  Configuration files for the Rails environment, the routing map, the database, and other dependencies.\n\ndb\n  Contains the database schema in schema.rb.  db/migrate contains all\n  the sequence of Migrations for your schema.\n\ndoc\n  This directory is where your application documentation will be stored when generated\n  using <tt>rake doc:app</tt>\n\nlib\n  Application specific libraries. Basically, any kind of custom code that doesn't\n  belong under controllers, models, or helpers. This directory is in the load path.\n\npublic\n  The directory available for the web server. Contains subdirectories for images, stylesheets,\n  and javascripts. Also contains the dispatchers and the default HTML files. This should be\n  set as the DOCUMENT_ROOT of your web server.\n\nscript\n  Helper scripts for automation and generation.\n\ntest\n  Unit and functional tests along with fixtures. When using the script/generate scripts, template\n  test files will be generated for you and placed in this directory.\n\nvendor\n  External libraries that the application depends on. Also includes the plugins subdirectory.\n  This directory is in the load path.\n\n",

This will\nleave you in the 'defunkt/master' branch after pulling changes from defunkt's\nremote.  After confirming that defunkt's changes were what you wanted, run git\ncheckout master and then git merge defunkt/master to merge defunkt's changes\ninto your own master branch.  In summary:\n$ gh pull defunkt\n$ gh checkout master\n$ gh merge defunkt/master\n\nIf you've already reviewed defunkt's changes and just want to merge them into your \nmaster branch, use the merge flag:\n$ gh pull --merge defunkt\n\nFetching and Evaluating Downstream Changes\nIf you are the maintainer of a project, you will often need to fetch commits\nfrom other developers, evaluate and/or test them, then merge them into the\nproject.\nLet's say you are 'defunkt' and 'mojombo' has forked your 'github-gem' repo,\nmade some changes and issues you a pull request for his 'master' branch.\nFrom the root of the project, you can do:\n$ gh fetch mojombo master\n\nThis will leave you in the 'mojombo/master' branch after fetching his commits.\nYour local 'mojombo/master' branch is now at the exact same place as mojombo's \n'master' branch. You can now run tests or evaluate the code for awesomeness.\nIf mojombo's changes are good, you'll want to merge your 'master' (or another\nbranch) into those changes so you can retest post-integration:\n$ gh merge master\n\nTest/analyze again and if everything is ok:\n$ gh checkout master\n$ gh merge mojombo/master\n\nThe latter command will be a fast-forward merge since you already did the\nreal merge previously.\nNetwork Patch Queue\nThe github gem can also show you all of the commits that exist on any fork of your\nproject (your network) that you don't have in your branch yet.  In order to see\nthe list of the projects that have commits you do not, you can run:\n$ gh network list\n\nWhich will show you all the forks that have changes.

If you want to incorporate them, you can use:\n$ gh cherry-pick ee013a\n\nfor example to apply that single patch to your branch.  You can also merge a branch, \nif you want all the changes introduced in another branch:\n$ gh merge jchris/gist\n\nThe next time you run the 'github network commits' command, you won't see any of the \npatches you have cherry-picked or merged (or rebased).  If you want to ignore a \ncommit, you can simply run:\n$ gh ignore a8c3eb\n\nThen you won't ever see that commit again. Or, if you want to ignore a range of commits,\nyou can use the normal Git revision selection shorthands - for example, if you want\nto ignore all 7 jchris/gist commits there, you can run:\n$ gh ignore ..jchris/gist\n\nYou can also filter the output, if you want to see some subset.  You can filter by project,\nauthor and date range, or (one of the cooler things) you can filter by whether the patch\napplies cleanly to your branch head or not.

    "Name": "aasm",
    "Readme": "AASM - Ruby state machines\n\n\n\n\nThis package contains AASM, a library for adding finite state machines to Ruby classes.\nAASM started as the acts_as_state_machine plugin but has evolved into a more generic library\nthat no longer targets only ActiveRecord models. It currently provides adapters for\nActiveRecord,\nMongoid, and Mongomapper but it can be used for any Ruby class, no matter what\nparent class it has (if any).\nUpgrade from version 3 to 4\nTake a look at the README_FROM_VERSION_3_TO_4 for details how to switch from version 3.x to 4.0 of AASM.\nUsage\nAdding a state machine is as simple as including the AASM module and start defining\nstates and events together with their transitions:\nclass Job\n  include AASM\n\n  aasm do\n    state :sleeping, :initial => true\n    state :running, :cleaning\n\n    event :run do\n      transitions :from => :sleeping, :to => :running\n    end\n\n    event :clean do\n      transitions :from => :running, :to => :cleaning\n    end\n\n    event :sleep do\n      transitions :from => [:running, :cleaning], :to => :sleeping\n    end\n  end\n\nend\nThis provides you with a couple of public methods for instances of the class Job:\njob = Job.new\njob.sleeping? # => true\njob.may_run?  # => true\njob.run\njob.running?  # => true\njob.sleeping? # => false\njob.may_run?  # => false\njob.run       # => raises AASM::InvalidTransition\nIf you don't like exceptions and prefer a simple true or false as response, tell\nAASM not to be whiny:\nclass Job\n  ...\n  aasm :whiny_transitions => false do\n    ...\n  end\nend\n\njob.running?  # => true\njob.may_run?  # => false\njob.run       # => false\nWhen firing an event, you can pass a block to the method, it will be called only if\nthe transition succeeds :\n  job.run do\n    job.user.notify_job_ran # Will be called if job.may_run? is true\n  end\nCallbacks\nYou can define a number of callbacks for your transitions. These methods will be\ncalled, when certain criteria are met, like entering a particular state:\nclass Job\n  include AASM\n\n  aasm do\n    state :sleeping, :initial => true, :before_enter => :do_something\n    state :running\n    state :finished\n\n    after_all_transitions :log_status_change\n\n    event :run, :after => :notify_somebody do\n      before do\n        log('Preparing to run')\n      end\n\n      transitions :from => :sleeping, :to => :running, :after => Proc.new {|*args| set_process(*args) }\n      transitions :from => :running, :to => :finished, :after => LogRunTime\n    end\n\n    event :sleep do\n      after do\n        ...\n      end\n      error do |e|\n        ...\n      end\n      transitions :from => :running, :to => :sleeping\n    end\n  end\n\n  def log_status_change\n    puts \"changing from #{aasm.from_state} to #{aasm.to_state} (event: #{aasm.current_event})\"\n  end\n\n  def set_process(name)\n    ...\n  end\n\n  def do_something\n    ...\n  end\n\n  def notify_somebody\n    ...\n  end\n\nend\n\nclass LogRunTime\n  def call\n    log \"Job was running for X seconds\"\n  end\nend\nIn this case do_something is called before actually entering the state sleeping,\nwhile notify_somebody is called after the transition run (from sleeping to running)\nis finished.\nAASM will also initialize LogRunTime and run the call method for you after the transition from running to finished in the example above. You can pass arguments to the class by defining an initialize method on it, like this:\nclass LogRunTime\n  # optional args parameter can be omitted, but if you define initialize\n  # you must accept the model instance as the first parameter to it.\n  def initialize(job, args = {})\n    @job = job\n  end\n\n  def call\n    log \"Job was running for #{@job.run_time} seconds\"\n  end\nend\nHere you can see a list of all possible callbacks, together with their order of calling:\nbegin\n  event           before_all_events\n  event           before\n  event           guards\n  transition      guards\n  old_state       before_exit\n  old_state       exit\n                  after_all_transitions\n  transition      after\n  new_state       before_enter\n  new_state       enter\n  ...update state...\n  transition      success             # if persist successful\n  event           success             # if persist successful\n  old_state       after_exit\n  new_state       after_enter\n  event           after\n  event           after_all_events\nrescue\n  event           error\n  event           error_on_all_events\nensure\n  event           ensure\n  event           ensure_on_all_events\nend\nAlso, you can pass parameters to events:\n  job = Job.new\n  job.run(:running, :defragmentation)\nIn this case the set_process would be called with :defragmentation argument.\nNote that when passing arguments to a state transition, the first argument must be the desired end state. In the above example, we wish to transition to :running state and run the callback with :defragmentation argument. You can also pass in nil as the desired end state, and AASM will try to transition to the first end state defined for that event.\nIn case of an error during the event processing the error is rescued and passed to :error\ncallback, which can handle it or re-raise it for further propagation.\nDuring the transition's :after callback (and reliably only then, or in the global\nafter_all_transitions callback) you can access the originating state (the from-state)\nand the target state (the to state), like this:\n  def set_process(name)\n    logger.info \"from #{aasm.from_state} to #{aasm.to_state}\"\n  end\nThe current event triggered\nWhile running the callbacks you can easily retrieve the name of the event triggered\nby using aasm.current_event:\n  # taken the example callback from above\n  def do_something\n    puts \"triggered #{aasm.current_event}\"\n  end\nand then\n  job = Job.new\n\n  # without bang\n  job.sleep # => triggered :sleep\n\n  # with bang\n  job.sleep! # => triggered :sleep!\nGuards\nLet's assume you want to allow particular transitions only if a defined condition is\ngiven. For this you can set up a guard per transition, which will run before actually\nrunning the transition. If the guard returns false the transition will be\ndenied (raising AASM::InvalidTransition or returning false itself):\nclass Cleaner\n  include AASM\n\n  aasm do\n    state :idle, :initial => true\n    state :cleaning\n\n    event :clean do\n      transitions :from => :idle, :to => :cleaning, :guard => :cleaning_needed?\n    end\n\n    event :clean_if_needed do\n      transitions :from => :idle, :to => :cleaning do\n        guard do\n          cleaning_needed?\n        end\n      end\n      transitions :from => :idle, :to => :idle\n    end\n  end\n\n  def cleaning_needed?\n    false\n  end\nend\n\njob = Cleaner.new\njob.may_clean?            # => false\njob.clean                 # => raises AASM::InvalidTransition\njob.may_clean_if_needed?  # => true\njob.clean_if_needed!      # idle\nYou can even provide a number of guards, which all have to succeed to proceed\n    def walked_the_dog?; ...; end\n\n    event :sleep do\n      transitions :from => :running, :to => :sleeping, :guards => [:cleaning_needed?, :walked_the_dog?]\n    end\nIf you want to provide guards for all transitions within an event, you can use event guards\n    event :sleep, :guards => [:walked_the_dog?] do\n      transitions :from => :running, :to => :sleeping, :guards => [:cleaning_needed?]\n      transitions :from => :cleaning, :to => :sleeping\n    end\nIf you prefer a more Ruby-like guard syntax, you can use if and unless as well:\n    event :clean do\n      transitions :from => :running, :to => :cleaning, :if => :cleaning_needed?\n    end\n\n    event :sleep do\n      transitions :from => :running, :to => :sleeping, :unless => :cleaning_needed?\n    end\n  end\nTransitions\nIn the event of having multiple transitions for an event, the first transition that successfully completes will stop other transitions in the same event from being processed.\nrequire 'aasm'\n\nclass Job\n  include AASM\n\n  aasm do\n    state :stage1, :initial => true\n    state :stage2\n    state :stage3\n    state :completed\n\n    event :stage1_completed do\n      transitions from: :stage1, to: :stage3, guard: :stage2_completed?\n      transitions from: :stage1, to: :stage2\n    end\n  end\n\n  def stage2_completed?\n    true\n  end\nend\n\njob = Job.new\njob.stage1_completed\njob.aasm.current_state # stage3\nMultiple state machines per class\nMultiple state machines per class are supported. Be aware though that AASM has been\nbuilt with one state machine per class in mind. Nonetheless, here's how to do it:\nclass SimpleMultipleExample\n  include AASM\n  aasm(:move) do\n    state :standing, :initial => true\n    state :walking\n    state :running\n\n    event :walk do\n      transitions :from => :standing, :to => :walking\n    end\n    event :run do\n      transitions :from => [:standing, :walking], :to => :running\n    end\n    event :hold do\n      transitions :from => [:walking, :running], :to => :standing\n    end\n  end\n\n  aasm(:work) do\n    state :sleeping, :initial => true\n    state :processing\n\n    event :start do\n      transitions :from => :sleeping, :to => :processing\n    end\n    event :stop do\n      transitions :from => :processing, :to => :sleeping\n    end\n  end\nend\n\nsimple = SimpleMultipleExample.new\n\nsimple.aasm(:move).current_state\n# => :standing\nsimple.aasm(:work).current\n# => :sleeping\n\nsimple.start\nsimple.aasm(:move).current_state\n# => :standing\nsimple.aasm(:work).current\n# => :processing\n\nAASM doesn't prohibit to define the same event in more than one state machine. The\nlatest definition \"wins\" and overrides previous definitions. Nonetheless, a warning is issued:\nSimpleMultipleExample: overriding method 'run'!.\nAll AASM class- and instance-level aasm methods accept a state machine selector.\nSo, for example, to use inspection on a class level, you have to use\nSimpleMultipleExample.aasm(:work).states\n# => [:standing, :walking, :running]\nFinal note: Support for multiple state machines per class is a pretty new feature\n(since version 4.3), so please bear with us in case it doesn't work as expected.\nAuto-generated Status Constants\nAASM automatically generates constants\nfor each status so you don't have to explicitly define them.\nclass Foo\n  include AASM\n\n  aasm do\n    state :initialized\n    state :calculated\n    state :finalized\n  end\nend\n\n> Foo::STATE_INITIALIZED\n#=> :initialized\n> Foo::STATE_CALCULATED\n#=> :calculated\nExtending AASM\nAASM allows you to easily extend AASM::Base for your own application purposes.\nLet's suppose we have common logic across many AASM models. We can embody this logic in a sub-class of AASM::Base.\nclass CustomAASMBase < AASM::Base\n  # A custom transiton that we want available across many AASM models.\n  def count_transitions!\n    klass.class_eval do\n      aasm :with_klass => CustomAASMBase do\n        after_all_transitions :increment_transition_count\n      end\n    end\n  end\n\n  # A custom annotation that we want available across many AASM models.\n  def requires_guards!\n    klass.class_eval do\n      attr_reader :authorizable_called,\n        :transition_count,\n        :fillable_called\n\n      def authorizable?\n        @authorizable_called = true\n      end\n\n      def fillable?\n        @fillable_called = true\n      end\n\n      def increment_transition_count\n        @transition_count ||= 0\n        @transition_count += 1\n      end\n    end\n  end\nend\nWhen we declare our model that has an AASM state machine, we simply declare the AASM block with a :with key to our own class.\nclass SimpleCustomExample\n  include AASM\n\n  # Let's build an AASM state machine with our custom class.\n  aasm :with_klass => CustomAASMBase do\n    requires_guards!\n    count_transitions!\n\n    state :initialised, :initial => true\n    state :filled_out\n    state :authorised\n\n    event :fill_out do\n      transitions :from => :initialised, :to => :filled_out, :guard => :fillable?\n    end\n    event :authorise do\n      transitions :from => :filled_out, :to => :authorised, :guard => :authorizable?\n    end\n  end\nend\nActiveRecord\nAASM comes with support for ActiveRecord and allows automatic persisting of the object's\nstate in the database.\nclass Job < ActiveRecord::Base\n  include AASM\n\n  aasm do # default column: aasm_state\n    state :sleeping, :initial => true\n    state :running\n\n    event :run do\n      transitions :from => :sleeping, :to => :running\n    end\n\n    event :sleep do\n      transitions :from => :running, :to => :sleeping\n    end\n  end\n\nend\nYou can tell AASM to auto-save the object or leave it unsaved\njob = Job.new\njob.run   # not saved\njob.run!  # saved\nSaving includes running all validations on the Job class, and returns true if\nsuccessful or false if errors occur. Exceptions are not raised.\nIf you want make sure the state gets saved without running validations (and\nthereby maybe persisting an invalid object state), simply tell AASM to skip the\nvalidations. Be aware that when skipping validations, only the state column will\nbe updated in the database (just like ActiveRecord update_column is working).\nclass Job < ActiveRecord::Base\n  include AASM\n\n  aasm :skip_validation_on_save => true do\n    state :sleeping, :initial => true\n    state :running\n\n    event :run do\n      transitions :from => :sleeping, :to => :running\n    end\n\n    event :sleep do\n      transitions :from => :running, :to => :sleeping\n    end\n  end\n\nend\nIf you want to make sure that the AASM column for storing the state is not directly assigned,\nconfigure AASM to not allow direct assignment, like this:\nclass Job < ActiveRecord::Base\n  include AASM\n\n  aasm :no_direct_assignment => true do\n    state :sleeping, :initial => true\n    state :running\n\n    event :run do\n      transitions :from => :sleeping, :to => :running\n    end\n  end\n\nend\nresulting in this:\njob = Job.create\njob.aasm_state # => 'sleeping'\njob.aasm_state = :running # => raises AASM::NoDirectAssignmentError\njob.aasm_state # => 'sleeping'\nActiveRecord enums\nYou can use\nenumerations\nin Rails 4.1+ for your state column:\nclass Job < ActiveRecord::Base\n  include AASM\n\n  enum state: {\n    sleeping: 5,\n    running: 99\n  }\n\n  aasm :column => :state, :enum => true do\n    state :sleeping, :initial => true\n    state :running\n  end\nend\nYou can explicitly pass the name of the method which provides access\nto the enumeration mapping as a value of enum, or you can simply\nset it to true. In the latter case AASM will try to use\npluralized column name to access possible enum states.\nFurthermore, if your column has integer type (which is normally the\ncase when you're working with Rails enums), you can omit :enum\nsetting --- AASM auto-detects this situation and enabled enum\nsupport. If anything goes wrong, you can disable enum functionality\nand fall back to the default behavior by setting :enum\nto false.\nSequel\nAASM also supports Sequel besides ActiveRecord, Mongoid, and MongoMapper.\nclass Job < Sequel::Model\n  include AASM\n\n  aasm do # default column: aasm_state\n    ...\n  end\nend\nHowever it's not yet as feature complete as ActiveRecord. For example, there are\nscopes defined yet. See Automatic Scopes.\nDynamoid\nSince version 4.8.0 AASM also supports Dynamoid as\npersistence ORM.\nMongoid\nAASM also supports persistence to Mongodb if you're using Mongoid. Make sure\nto include Mongoid::Document before you include AASM.\nclass Job\n  include Mongoid::Document\n  include AASM\n  field :aasm_state\n  aasm do\n    ...\n  end\nend\nMongoMapper\nAASM also supports persistence to Mongodb if you're using MongoMapper. Make sure\nto include MongoMapper::Document before you include AASM.\nclass Job\n  include MongoMapper::Document\n  include AASM\n\n  key :aasm_state,                   Symbol\n  aasm do\n    ...\n  end\nend\nRedis\nAASM also supports persistence in Redis.\nMake sure to include Redis::Objects before you include AASM.\nclass User\n  include Redis::Objects\n  include AASM\n\n  aasm do\n  end\nend\nAutomatic Scopes\nAASM will automatically create scope methods for each state in the model.\nclass Job < ActiveRecord::Base\n  include AASM\n\n  aasm do\n    state :sleeping, :initial => true\n    state :running\n    state :cleaning\n  end\n\n  def self.sleeping\n    \"This method name is already in use\"\n  end\nend\nclass JobsController < ApplicationController\n  def index\n    @running_jobs = Job.running\n    @recent_cleaning_jobs = Job.cleaning.where('created_at >=  ?', 3.days.ago)\n\n    # @sleeping_jobs = Job.sleeping   #=> \"This method name is already in use\"\n  end\nend\nIf you don't need scopes (or simply don't want them), disable their creation when\ndefining the AASM states, like this:\nclass Job < ActiveRecord::Base\n  include AASM\n\n  aasm :create_scopes => false do\n    state :sleeping, :initial => true\n    state :running\n    state :cleaning\n  end\nend\nTransaction support\nSince version 3.0.13 AASM supports ActiveRecord transactions. So whenever a transition\ncallback or the state update fails, all changes to any database record are rolled back.\nMongodb does not support transactions.\nThere are currently 3 transactional callbacks that can be handled on the event, and 2 transactional callbacks for all events.\n  event           before_all_transactions\n  event           before_transaction\n  event           aasm_fire_event (within transaction)\n  event           after_commit (if event successful)\n  event           after_transaction\n  event           after_all_transactions\nIf you want to make sure a depending action happens only after the transaction is committed,\nuse the after_commit callback along with the auto-save (bang) methods, like this:\nclass Job < ActiveRecord::Base\n  include AASM\n\n  aasm do\n    state :sleeping, :initial => true\n    state :running\n\n    event :run, :after_commit => :notify_about_running_job do\n      transitions :from => :sleeping, :to => :running\n    end\n  end\n\n  def notify_about_running_job\n    ...\n  end\nend\n\njob = Job.where(state: 'sleeping').first!\njob.run! # Saves the model and triggers the after_commit callback\nNote that the following will not run the after_commit callbacks because\nthe auto-save method is not used:\njob = Job.where(state: 'sleeping').first!\njob.run\njob.save! #notify_about_running_job is not run\nIf you want to encapsulate state changes within an own transaction, the behavior\nof this nested transaction might be confusing. Take a look at\nActiveRecord Nested Transactions\nif you want to know more about this. Nevertheless, AASM by default requires a new transaction\ntransaction(:requires_new => true). You can override this behavior by changing\nthe configuration\nclass Job < ActiveRecord::Base\n  include AASM\n\n  aasm :requires_new_transaction => false do\n    ...\n  end\n\n  ...\nend\nwhich then leads to transaction(:requires_new => false), the Rails default.\nPessimistic Locking\nAASM supports Active Record pessimistic locking via with_lock for database persistence layers.\n\n\nOption\nPurpose\n\n\n\nfalse (default)\nNo lock is obtained\n\n\ntrue\nObtain a blocking pessimistic lock e.g. FOR UPDATE\n\n\nString\nObtain a lock based on the SQL string e.g. FOR UPDATE NOWAIT\n\n\nclass Job < ActiveRecord::Base\n  include AASM\n\n  aasm :requires_lock => true do\n    ...\n  end\n\n  ...\nend\nclass Job < ActiveRecord::Base\n  include AASM\n\n  aasm :requires_lock => 'FOR UPDATE NOWAIT' do\n    ...\n  end\n\n  ...\nend\nColumn name & migration\nAs a default AASM uses the column aasm_state to store the states. You can override\nthis by defining your favorite column name, using :column like this:\nclass Job < ActiveRecord::Base\n  include AASM\n\n  aasm :column => 'my_state' do\n    ...\n  end\n\nend\nWhatever column name is used, make sure to add a migration to provide this column\n(of type string):\nclass AddJobState < ActiveRecord::Migration\n  def self.up\n    add_column :jobs, :aasm_state, :string\n  end\n\n  def self.down\n    remove_column :jobs, :aasm_state\n  end\nend\nInspection\nAASM supports query methods for states and events\nGiven the following Job class:\nclass Job\n  include AASM\n\n  aasm do\n    state :sleeping, :initial => true\n    state :running, :cleaning\n\n    event :run do\n      transitions :from => :sleeping, :to => :running\n    end\n\n    event :clean do\n      transitions :from => :running, :to => :cleaning, :guard => :cleaning_needed?\n    end\n\n    event :sleep do\n      transitions :from => [:running, :cleaning], :to => :sleeping\n    end\n  end\n\n  def cleaning_needed?\n    false\n  end\nend\n# show all states\nJob.aasm.states.map(&:name) \n#=> [:sleeping, :running, :cleaning]\n\njob = Job.new\n\n# show all permitted states (from initial state)\njob.aasm.states(:permitted => true).map(&:name) \n#=> [:running]\n\njob.run\njob.aasm.states(:permitted => true).map(&:name)\n#=> [:sleeping]\n\n# show all non permitted states\njob.aasm.states(:permitted => false).map(&:name) \n#=> [:cleaning]\n\n# show all possible (triggerable) events from the current state\njob.aasm.events.map(&:name)\n#=> [:clean, :sleep]\n\n# show all permitted events\njob.aasm.events(:permitted => true).map(&:name)\n#=> [:sleep]\n\n# show all non permitted events\njob.aasm.events(:permitted => false).map(&:name)\n#=> [:clean]\n\n# show all possible events except a specific one\njob.aasm.events(:reject => :sleep).map(&:name)\n#=> [:clean]\n\n# list states for select\nJob.aasm.states_for_select\n=> [[\"Sleeping\", \"sleeping\"], [\"Running\", \"running\"], [\"Cleaning\", \"cleaning\"]]\n\n# show permitted states with guard parameter\njob.aasm.states({:permitted => true}, guard_parameter).map(&:name)\nWarning output\nWarnings are by default printed to STDERR. If you want to log those warnings to another output,\nuse\nclass Job\n  include AASM\n\n  aasm :logger => Rails.logger do\n    ...\n  end\nend\nBe aware though, that this is not yet released. It will be part of AASM version 4.11.0.\nRubyMotion support\nNow supports CodeDataQuery !\nHowever I'm still in the process of submitting my compatibility updates to their repository.\nIn the meantime you can use my fork, there may still be some minor issues but I intend to extensively use it myself, so fixes should come fast.\nWarnings:\n\nDue to RubyMotion Proc's lack of 'source_location' method, it may be harder\nto find out the origin of a \"cannot transition from\" error. I would recommend using\nthe 'instance method symbol / string' way whenever possible when defining guardians and callbacks.\n\nTesting\nAASM provides some matchers for RSpec: transition_from, have_state, allow_event and allow_transition_to. Add require 'aasm/rspec' to your spec_helper.rb file and use them like this\n# classes with only the default state machine\njob = Job.new\nexpect(job).to transition_from(:sleeping).to(:running).on_event(:run)\nexpect(job).not_to transition_from(:sleeping).to(:cleaning).on_event(:run)\nexpect(job).to have_state(:sleeping)\nexpect(job).not_to have_state(:running)\nexpect(job).to allow_event :run\nexpect(job).to_not allow_event :clean\nexpect(job).to allow_transition_to(:running)\nexpect(job).to_not allow_transition_to(:cleaning)\n# on_event also accept arguments\nexpect(job).to transition_from(:sleeping).to(:running).on_event(:run, :defragmentation)\n\n# classes with multiple state machine\nmultiple = SimpleMultipleExample.new\nexpect(multiple).to transition_from(:standing).to(:walking).on_event(:walk).on(:move)\nexpect(multiple).to_not transition_from(:standing).to(:running).on_event(:walk).on(:move)\nexpect(multiple).to have_state(:standing).on(:move)\nexpect(multiple).not_to have_state(:walking).on(:move)\nexpect(multiple).to allow_event(:walk).on(:move)\nexpect(multiple).to_not allow_event(:hold).on(:move)\nexpect(multiple).to allow_transition_to(:walking).on(:move)\nexpect(multiple).to_not allow_transition_to(:running).on(:move)\nexpect(multiple).to transition_from(:sleeping).to(:processing).on_event(:start).on(:work)\nexpect(multiple).to_not transition_from(:sleeping).to(:sleeping).on_event(:start).on(:work)\nexpect(multiple).to have_state(:sleeping).on(:work)\nexpect(multiple).not_to have_state(:processing).on(:work)\nexpect(multiple).to allow_event(:start).on(:move)\nexpect(multiple).to_not allow_event(:stop).on(:move)\nexpect(multiple).to allow_transition_to(:processing).on(:move)\nexpect(multiple).to_not allow_transition_to(:sleeping).on(:move)\nInstallation\n\nManually from RubyGems.org\n% gem install aasm\nOr if you are using Bundler\n# Gemfile\ngem 'aasm'\nBuilding your own gems\n% rake build\n% sudo gem install pkg/aasm-x.y.z.gem\nGenerators\nAfter installing AASM you can run generator:\n% rails generate aasm NAME [COLUMN_NAME]\nReplace NAME with the Model name, COLUMN_NAME is optional(default is 'aasm_state').\nThis will create a model (if one does not exist) and configure it with aasm block.\nFor Active record orm a migration file is added to add aasm state column to table.\nLatest changes\nTake a look at the CHANGELOG for details about recent changes to the current version.\nQuestions?\nFeel free to\n\ncreate an issue on GitHub\nask a question on StackOverflow (tag with aasm)\nsend us a tweet @aasm\n\nMaintainers\n\nScott Barron (2006\u20132009, original author)\nTravis Tilley (2009\u20132011)\nThorsten B\u00f6ttger (since 2011)\nAnil Maurya (since 2016)\n\nContributing\n\nRead the Contributor Code of Conduct\nFork it\nCreate your feature branch (git checkout -b my-new-feature)\nCommit your changes (git commit -am 'Added some feature')\nPush to the branch (git push origin my-new-feature)\nCreate new Pull Request\n\nWarranty\nThis software is provided \"as is\" and without any express or\nimplied warranties, including, without limitation, the implied\nwarranties of merchantibility and fitness for a particular\npurpose.\nLicense\nCopyright (c) 2006-2016 Scott Barron\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining\na copy of this software and associated documentation files (the\n\"Software\"), to deal in the Software without restriction, including\nwithout limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish,\ndistribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to\npermit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to\nthe following conditions:\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be\nincluded in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,\nEXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF\nMERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND\nNONINFRINGEMENT.

    "Name": "fixture-scenarios",
    "Readme": "Copyright (c) 2007 Tom Preston-Werner\n\n=FixtureScenarios\n\nThis plugin allows you to create \"scenarios\" which are collections of fixtures\nand ruby files that represent a context against which you can run tests.\n\n==Disclaimer\n\nThis software is in Beta.\nSend feedback to tom at rubyisawesome dot com or find me (mojombo) on irc.freenode.net.\n\n==Installation\n\nFixtureScenarios should work on both 1.1.6 and edge rails.\nCurrently you must install this plugin from the subversion repository\n\n  script/plugin install http://fixture-scenarios.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/fixture_scenarios\n\n==WARNING\n\nBecause this plugin clears out fixture data between your test classes, you may\nsee some of your tests fail after installation. If this occurs, look at your\ntests to see if you didn't actually load a required fixture for that test\nclass. If you forgot to add it and your tests passed anyway (because of\nfixture contamination), just add the missing fixture(s) and you'll be good\nto go.\n\n==The Basics\n\nTo create a scenario, simply create a subdirectory under test/fixtures in your\nRails app. The name of the subdirectory will be the name of the scenario.\nInside this new directory, you can place fixture files, and/or Ruby files.\n\n  [RAILS_ROOT]\n  +-test/\n    +-fixtures/\n      +-brand_new_user/\n        +-users.yml\n\n  # in users.yml\n  borges:\n    id: 1\n    name: Jorge Luis Borges\n    active: 1\n\nTo load the scenario for testing, you simply use the +scenario+ method instead\nof the normal +fixtures+ method.\n\n  require File.dirname(__FILE__) + '/../test_helper'\n\n  class UserTest < Test::Unit::TestCase\n    scenario :brand_new_user\n\n    def test_should_be_active\n      assert users(:borges).active?\n    end\n  end\n\nAll of the fixtures placed into your scenario directory will be loaded when\nyou invoke the +scenario+ method with your scenario name. In addition, any\nRuby files you place in the scenario directory will be run after the fixtures.\nYou can use a Ruby file to create non-database model instances, set up\nrelationships between fixtures (instead of creating fixtures for the join\ntables), or replace fixtures entirely by creating your database items with\nRuby code.\n\nIn this example, +scenario+ will actually load all fixtures from the fixture\ndirectory *and* your scenario directory. This is useful if you have some\nfixtures (such as lookup data) that you'd like to have in most of your\nscenarios. To prevent the loading of fixtures in the fixtures root directory,\nuse the <tt>:root</tt> option. This can be very useful if you still have tests\nusing regular fixtures.\n\n  scenario :brand_new_user, :root => false\n\nIf you've just started FixtureScenarios on an existing project, adding\n:root => false to every scenario call will become tedious, so you can set\nthe option globally in your test_helper.rb (inside the Test::Unit::TestCase\nclass) like so:\n\n  self.scenarios_load_root_fixtures = false\n\nTo keep things DRY in your scenarios, you can extend or layer scenarios on top\nof each other. Following with our example, to create an \"experienced user\"\nscenario, we could create another subdirectory under the existing\n\"brand_new_user\" that would contain fixture/Ruby files that add upon the\n\"brand new user\" scenario.\n\n  [RAILS_ROOT]\n  +-test/\n    +-fixtures/\n      +-brand_new_user/\n        +-users.yml\n        +-experienced_user/\n          +-articles.yml\n\nNow when you load the +experienced_user+ scenario, it will load any\nfixture/Ruby files in \"fixtures\", then in \"brand_new_user\", then in\n\"experienced_user\"! Building off of your existing scenarios keeps data\nredundancy to a minimum, and makes it easy to change data for multiple\nscenarios simultaneously.\n\n==Testing your scenarios\n\nScenarios represent your assumptions about a given context. If these\nassumptions are wrong, your tests will be inaccurate. Your scenarios should be\nunit tested along with the rest of your application. This plugin allows you to\nplace scenario tests in a \"scenario\" directory under your \"test\" directory.\n\n  [RAILS_ROOT]\n  +-test/\n    +-scenario/\n      +-brand_new_user_test.rb\n      +-experienced_user_test.rb\n\nYou can run these tests with rake.\n\n  rake test:scenarios  # run just scenario tests\n  rake                 # run unit, functional, integration, and scenario tests\n\nScenario tests will protect you from accidentally changing your assumptions in\na dangerous or transparent way when modifying existing scenarios.\n",

    "Readme": "Mongrel process title GemPlugin\n===============================\n\nThis is a simple plugin for Mongrel which changes the process title to reflect\nwhat it's currently doing. You can then determine a given Mongrel server's \nstatus using \"ps\". \n\nFor example:\n\n  mongrel_rails [10010/2/358]: handling 127.0.0.1: HEAD /feed/cal/global/91/6de4\n                 |     | |     |        |          |\n                 |     | |     |        |          The current req (method / path)\n                 |     | |     |        |\n                 |     | |     |        The client IP\n                 |     | |     |\n                 |     | |     What it's doing\n                 |     | |     \n                 |     | Requests processed during server lifetime\n                 |     |\n                 |     Requests currently queued/being processed concurrently\n                 |\n                 The port that Mongrel is serving\n\nThis is almost entirely based on Alexander Staubo's Rails plugin with the same \nname:\n\nhttp://purefiction.net/mongrel_proctitle/\n\nThe main difference is that the GemPlugin will automatically be loaded by all\nmongrels without additional code changes or configuration.\n\nMonitoring Mongrels\n-------------------\n\nOnce the program is installed, you should be able to see the formatted process\ntitle by running:\n\n    $ ps -axwwo pid,command | grep mongrel_rails\n\nSee ps(1) for more options. You may want to include %cpu, rsz, %mem, or other\nfields in output.\n\nThere's also a `mongrel_top` executable included in the gem that works like\ntop(1) but displays only mongrel processes:\n\n    $ mongrel_top\n\nBy default, `mongrel_top` updates the display every 0.25 seconds and shows the\npid and process title. You can select a different interval and fields with the\n-s and -o arguments, respectively: \n\n    $ mongrel_top -s 0.1 -o pid,%cpu,rsz,command\n\nThe \"command\" field must be included.\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\nThis version of the plugin is packaged specifically as a Mongrel GemPlugin. Install \nusing:\n\n   gem install mongrel_proctitle --source=http://tomayko.com\n\nOnce installed, all new mongrels will automatically load the plugin during startup. If\nyou would prefer to control which mongrels load the plugin, do not install this gem.\nUse the directions below instead.\n\nInstalling into a specific Rails app only\n-----------------------------------------\n\nSee Alexander Staubo's original project:\n\nhttp://purefiction.net/mongrel_proctitle/\n\nShowing your application-specific revision/release in the title\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIn your application's start-up process, re-open Mongrel::Proctitler\nand define a get_app_revision method. In a Rails app, a good place\nto do this is in RAILS_ROOT/config/environments/production.rb. An\nexample get_app_revision method might look like:\n\n  def get_app_revision\n    `cat ./REVISION`.chomp\n  end\n\nLicense\n-------\n\nI've included the LICENSE file from the original mongrel_proctitle distribution.

Use the handy\nhelpers to install helper methods on Sinatra::EventContext for use\ninside events and templates.\nExample:\nhelpers do\n\n  def bar(name)\n    \"#{name}bar\"\n  end\n\nend\n\nget '/:name' do\n  bar(params[:name])\nend\nBefore filters\nThese are run in Sinatra::EventContext\nbefore do\n  .. this code will run before each event ..\nend\nHalt!\nTo immediately stop a request during a before filter or event use:\nthrow :halt\nVariations\nSet the body to the result of a helper method\nthrow :halt, :helper_method\nSet the body to the result of a helper method after sending it parameters\nfrom the local scope\nthrow :halt, [:helper_method, foo, bar]\nSet the body to a simple string\nthrow :halt, 'this will be the body'\nSet status then the body\nthrow :halt, [401, 'go away!']\nSet the status then call a helper method with params from local scope\nthrow :halt, [401, [:helper_method, foo, bar]]\nRun a proc inside the Sinatra::EventContext instance and set the body to\nthe result\nthrow :halt, lambda { puts 'In a proc!'; 'I just wrote to $stdout!' }\nCreate you own to_result\nclass MyResultObject\n  def to_result(event_context, *args)\n    event_context.body = 'This will be the body!\n  end\nend\n\nget '/' do\n  throw :halt, MyResultObject.new\nend\nGet the gist?  If you want more fun with this then checkout\nto_result on Array, Symbol, Fixnum, NilClass.\nConfiguration & Re-loading\nSinatra supports multiple environments and re-loading.  Re-loading happens\non every request when in :development.  Wrap your configurations in\nconfigure (i.e. Database connections, Constants, etc.) to protect\nthem from re-loading and to only work in certain environments.\nAll environments:\nconfigure do\n\nend\nProduction\nconfigure :production do\n\nend\nTwo at a time:\nconfigure :production, :test do\n\nend\nThis is also really nifty for error handling.\nError handling\nNot Found\nRemember:  These are run inside the Sinatra::EventContext which means you\nget all the goodies is has to offer (i.e. haml, erb, :halt, etc.)\nWhenever NotFound is raised this will be called\nnot_found do\n  'This is nowhere to be found'\nend\nError\nBy default error will catch Sinatra::ServerError\nSinatra will pass you the error via the 'sinatra.error' in\nrequest.env\nerror do\n  'Sorry there was a nasty error - ' + request.env['sinatra.error'].name\nend\nCustom error mapping:\nerror MyCustomError do\n  'So what happened was...' + request.env['sinatra.error'].message\nend\nthen if this happens:\nget '/' do\n  raise MyCustomError, 'something bad'\nend\nyou gets this:\nSo what happened was... something bad\none guess what this does ;)\nnot_found do\n  'I have no clue what you're looking for'\nend\nTry it!\nBecause Sinatra give you a default not_found and error do\n:production that are secure.  If you want to customize only for :production\nbut want to keep the friendly helper screens for :development then do this:\nconfigure :production do\n\n  not_found do\n    \"We're so sorry, but we don't what this is\"\n  end\n\n  error do\n    \"Something really nasty happened.  We're on it!\"\n  end\n\nend\nMime types\nWhen using send_file or static files you may have mime types Sinatra\ndoesn't understand.  Use mime in those cases.\nmime :foo, 'text/foo'\nUsing Rack Middleware\nSinatra rides on Rack, a minimal\nstandard interface for Ruby web frameworks. One of Rack's most\ninteresting capabilities for application developers is support for\n\u201cmiddleware\u201d \u2013 components that sit between the server and your application\nmonitoring and/or manipulating the HTTP request/response to provide various\ntypes of common functionality. What's more, middleware is portable\nbetween web frameworks, so middleware components developed under, e.g.,\nMerb, can be used with Sinatra and vice versa.\nSinatra makes building Rack middleware pipelines a cinch via a top-level\nuse method:\nrequire 'sinatra'\nrequire 'my_custom_middleware'\n\nuse Rack::Lint\nuse MyCustomMiddleware\n\nget '/hello' do\n  'Hello World'\nend\nThe semantics of use are identical to those defined for the Rack::Builder\nDSL (most frequently used from rackup files). For example, the use\nmethod accepts multiple/variable args as well as blocks:\nuse Rack::Auth::Basic do |username, password|\n  username == 'admin' && password == 'secret'\nend\nRack is distributed with a variety of standard middleware for logging,\ndebugging, URL routing, authentication, and session handling. Sinatra uses\nmany of of these components automatically based on configuration so you\ntypically don't have to use them explicitly.\nTesting\nMethods\nget_it path, params\nget_it path, params.merge(:env => { 'HTTP_HOST' => 'www.sinatrarb.com' }) or\nget_it path, params.merge(:env => { :host => 'www.sinatrarb.com' })\nRESTful:\npost_it '/foo', '<myxml></myxml>', 'HTTP_ACCEPT' => 'application/xml'\nalso works with:\nget_it, post_it, put_it, delete_it, head_it\nTest/Unit\nrequire 'my_sinatra_app'\nrequire 'sinatra/test/unit'\n\nclass MyAppTest < Test::Unit::TestCase\n\n  def test_my_default\n    get_it '/'\n    assert_equal 'My Default Page!', @response.body\n  end\n\n  def test_with_agent\n    get_it '/', :agent => 'Songbird'\n    assert_equal 'You're in Songbird!', @response.body\n  end\n\n  ...\n\nend\nTest/Spec\nrequire 'my_sinatra_app'\nrequire 'sinatra/test/spec'\n\ncontext 'My app'\n\n  should \"show a default page\" do\n    get_it '/'\n    should.be.ok\n    body.should.equal 'My Default Page!'\n  end\n  ...\n\nend\nTest helpers\nSee Sinatra::Test::Methods\nIrb\nThis will be back in soon\nCommand line\nRun your sinatra file like:\nruby myapp.rb [options]\nOptions are:\n-h # help\n-p # set the port (default is 4567)\n-e # set the environment (default is development)\n-x # turn on the mutex lock (default is off)\nContribute\ncd where/you/keep/your/projects\ngit clone git://github.com/bmizerany/sinatra.git\ncd your_project\nln -s ../sinatra/\nat the top of your sinatra.rb file\n$:.unshift File.dirname(__FILE__) + '/sinatra/lib'\nrequire 'sinatra'\n\nget '/about' do\n  \"I'm running on Version \" + Sinatra::Version.combined\nend\n",

    "Name": "treetop",
    "Readme": "Support\nSupport for Treetop is provided through the mailing list you can join or browse here:\nhttp://groups.google.com/group/treetop-dev \nTutorial\nLanguages can be split into two components, their syntax and their semantics. It's your understanding of English syntax that tells you the stream of words \"Sleep furiously green ideas colorless\" is not a valid sentence. Semantics is deeper. Even if we rearrange the above sentence to be \"Colorless green ideas sleep furiously\", which is syntactically correct, it remains nonsensical on a semantic level. With Treetop, you'll be dealing with languages that are much simpler than English, but these basic concepts apply. Your programs will need to address both the syntax and the semantics of the languages they interpret.\nTreetop equips you with powerful tools for each of these two aspects of interpreter writing. You'll describe the syntax of your language with a parsing expression grammar. From this description, Treetop will generate a Ruby parser that transforms streams of characters written into your language into abstract syntax trees representing their structure. You'll then describe the semantics of your language in Ruby by defining methods on the syntax trees the parser generates.\nParsing Expression Grammars, The Basics\nThe first step in using Treetop is defining a grammar in a file with the .treetop extension. Here's a grammar that's useless because it's empty:\n# my_grammar.treetop\ngrammar MyGrammar\nend\n\nNext, you start filling your grammar with rules. Each rule associates a name with a parsing expression, like the following:\n# my_grammar.treetop\n# You can use a .tt extension instead if you wish\ngrammar MyGrammar\n  rule hello\n    'hello chomsky'\n  end\nend\n\nThe first rule becomes the root of the grammar, causing its expression to be matched when a parser for the grammar is fed a string. The above grammar can now be used in a Ruby program. Notice how a string matching the first rule parses successfully, but a second nonmatching string does not.\n# use_grammar.rb\nrequire 'rubygems'\nrequire 'treetop'\nTreetop.load 'my_grammar'\n# or just:\n# require 'my_grammar'                     # This works because Polyglot hooks \"require\" to find and load Treetop files\n\nparser = MyGrammarParser.new\nputs parser.parse('hello chomsky')         # => Treetop::Runtime::SyntaxNode\nputs parser.parse('silly generativists!')  # => nil\nUsers of regular expressions will find parsing expressions familiar. They share the same basic purpose, matching strings against patterns. However, parsing expressions can recognize a broader category of languages than their less expressive brethren. Before we get into demonstrating that, lets cover some basics. At first parsing expressions won't seem much different. Trust that they are.\nTerminal Symbols\nThe expression in the grammar above is a terminal symbol. It will only match a string that matches it exactly. There are two other kinds of terminal symbols, which we'll revisit later. Terminals are called atomic expressions because they aren't composed of smaller expressions.\nOrdered Choices\nOrdered choices are composite expressions, which allow for any of several subexpressions to be matched. These should be familiar from regular expressions, but in parsing expressions, they are delimited by the / character. Its important to note that the choices are prioritized in the order they appear. If an earlier expression is matched, no subsequent expressions are tried. Here's an example:\n# my_grammar.treetop\ngrammar MyGrammar\n  rule hello\n    'hello chomsky' / 'hello lambek'\n  end\nend\n\n# fragment of use_grammar.rb\nputs parser.parse('hello chomsky')         # => Treetop::Runtime::SyntaxNode\nputs parser.parse('hello lambek')          # => Treetop::Runtime::SyntaxNode\nputs parser.parse('silly generativists!')  # => nil\nNote that once a choice rule has matched the text using a particular alternative at a particular location in the input and hence has succeeded, that choice will never be reconsidered, even if the chosen alternative causes another rule to fail where a later alternative wouldn't have. It's always a later alternative, since the first to succeed is final - why keep looking when you've found what you wanted? This is a feature of PEG parsers that you need to understand if you're going to succeed in using Treetop. In order to memoize success and failures, such decisions cannot be reversed. Luckily Treetop provides a variety of clever ways you can tell it to avoid making the wrong decisions. But more on that later.\nSequences\nSequences are composed of other parsing expressions separated by spaces. Using sequences, we can tighten up the above grammar.\n# my_grammar.treetop\ngrammar MyGrammar\n  rule hello\n    'hello ' ('chomsky' / 'lambek')\n  end\nend\n\nNote the use of parentheses to override the default precedence rules, which bind sequences more tightly than choices.\nOnce the whole sequence has been matched, the result is memoized and the details of the match will not be reconsidered for that location in the input.\nNonterminal Symbols\nHere we leave regular expressions behind. Nonterminals allow expressions to refer to other expressions by name. A trivial use of this facility would allow us to make the above grammar more readable should the list of names grow longer.\n# my_grammar.treetop\ngrammar MyGrammar\n  rule hello\n    'hello ' linguist\n  end\n\n  rule linguist\n    'chomsky' / 'lambek' / 'jacobsen' / 'frege'\n  end\nend\n\nThe true power of this facility, however, is unleashed when writing recursive expressions. Here is a self-referential expression that can match any number of open parentheses followed by any number of closed parentheses. This is theoretically impossible with regular expressions due to the pumping lemma.\n# parentheses.treetop\ngrammar Parentheses\n  rule parens\n    '(' parens ')' / ''\n  end\nend\n\nThe parens expression simply states that a parens is a set of parentheses surrounding another parens expression or, if that doesn't match, the empty string. If you are uncomfortable with recursion, its time to get comfortable, because it is the basis of language. Here's a tip: Don't try and imagine the parser circling round and round through the same rule. Instead, imagine the rule is already defined while you are defining it. If you imagine that parens already matches a string of matching parentheses, then its easy to think of parens as an open and closing parentheses around another set of matching parentheses, which conveniently, you happen to be defining. You know that parens is supposed to represent a string of matched parentheses, so trust in that meaning, even if you haven't fully implemented it yet.\nRepetition\nAny item in a rule may be followed by a '+' or a '*' character, signifying one-or-more and zero-or-more occurrences of that item. Beware though; the match is greedy, and if it matches too many items and causes subsequent items in the sequence to fail, the number matched will never be reconsidered. Here's a simple example of a rule that will never succeed:\n# toogreedy.treetop\ngrammar TooGreedy\n  rule a_s\n    'a'* 'a'\n  end\nend\n\nThe 'a'* will always eat up any 'a's that follow, and the subsequent 'a' will find none there, so the whole rule will fail. You might need to use lookahead to avoid matching too much. Alternatively, you can use an occurrence range:\n# toogreedy.treetop\ngrammar TooGreedy\n  rule two_to_four_as\n    'a' 2..4\n  end\nend\n\nIn an occurrence range, you may omit either the minimum count or the maximum count, so that \"0.. \" works like \"*\" and \"1.. \" works like '+'.\nNegative Lookahead\nWhen you need to ensure that the following item doesn't match in some case where it might otherwise, you can use negat!ve lookahead, which is an item preceeded by a ! - here's an example:\n# postcondition.treetop\ngrammar PostCondition\n  rule conditional_sentence\n    ( !conditional_keyword word )+ conditional_keyword [ \\t]+ word*\n  end\n\n  rule word\n    ([a-zA-Z]+ [ \\t]+) \n  end\n\n  rule conditional_keyword\n    'if' / 'while' / 'until'\n  end\nend\n\nEven though the rule word would match any of the conditional keywords, the first words of a conditional_sentence must not be conditional_keywords. The negative lookahead prevents that matching, and prevents the repetition from matching too much input. Note that the lookahead may be a grammar rule of any complexity, including one that isn't used elsewhere in your grammar.\nPositive lookahead\nSometimes you want an item to match, but only if the following text would match some pattern. You don't want to consume that following text, but if it's not there, you want this rule to fail. You can append a positive lookahead like this to a rule by appending the lookahead rule preceeded by an & character.\nSemantic predicates\nWarning: This is an advanced feature. You need to understand the way a packrat parser operates to use it correctly. The result of computing a rule containing a semantic predicate will be memoized, even if the same rule, applied later at the same location in the input, would work differently due to a semantic predicate returning a different value. If you don't understand the previous sentence yet still use this feature, you're on your own, so test carefully!\nSometimes, you need to run external Ruby code to decide whether this syntax rule should continue or should fail. You can do this using either positive or negative semantic predicates. These are Ruby code blocks (lambdas) which are called when the parser reaches that location. For this rule to succeed, the value must be true for a positive predicate (a block like &{ ... }), or false for a negative predicate (a block like !{ ... }).\nThe block is called with one argument, the array containing the preceding syntax nodes in the current sequence. Within the block, you cannot use node names or labels for the preceding nodes, as the node for the current rule does not yet exist. You must refer to preceding nodes using their position in the sequence.\ngrammar Keywords\n  rule sequence_of_reserved_and_nonreserved_words\n    ( reserved / word )*\n  end\n\n  rule reserved\n    word &{ |s| symbol_reserved?(s[0].text_value) }\n  end\n\n  rule word\n    ([a-zA-Z]+ [ \\t]+) \n  end\nend\n\nOne case where it is always safe to use a semantic predicate is to invoke the Ruby debugger, but don't forget to return true so the rule succeeds! Assuming you have required the 'ruby-debug' module somewhere, it looks like this:\n  rule problems\n    word &{ |s| debugger; true }\n  end\n\nWhen the debugger stops here, you can inspect the contents of the SyntaxNode for \"word\" by looking at s[0], and the stack trace will show how you got there.\n",

    "Readme": "= rspec_hpricot_matchers\n\nAn implementation of have_tag(), as in rspec_on_rails, but sitting atop\nNokogiri rather than merely wrapping assert_select().\n\nSo at one point it was on Hpricot. But it's not now. Misnomers are more\nfun. You're probably better off using something like Webrat::Matchers\nanyhow.\n\n\n== Installation\n\nTo use rspec_hpricot_matchers in your project, install the gem, and\nadd the following to your spec_helper.rb file:\n\n  require 'rspec_hpricot_matchers'\n  Spec::Runner.configure do |config|\n    config.include(RspecHpricotMatchers)\n  end\n\nSimilarly, to make the matchers available to stories, you can add the\nfollowing to your stories/helper.rb file:\n\n  require 'rspec_hpricot_matchers'\n  include RspecHpricotMatchers\n\n\n== Usage\n\nAs its first argument, have_tag() accepts any CSS or XPath selectors\nwhich are supported by Hpricot.\n\n    body.should have_tag('form[@action*=session]')\n    body.should have_tag('ul > li + li')\n\nExpectations can be placed upon the inner text of the matched element\nby providing another argument, which should be either a String or a\nRegexp:\n\n    body.should have_tag('h1', 'Welcome')\n    body.should have_tag('p', /a very important blurb/i)\n\nExpectations can be placed upon the number of matched elements by\npassing an options hash:\n\n    body.should have_tag('abbr', :count => 1)   # exactly one\n    body.should have_tag('dt',   :minimum => 4) # at least 4\n    body.should have_tag('dd',   :maximum => 4) # at most 4\n    body.should have_tag('a.outgoing', /rspec/i, :count => 2)\n\nThe :count key also accepts a Range, making the following equivalent:\n\n    body.should have_tag('tr',   :count => 3..5)\n    body.should have_tag('tr',   :minimum => 3,\n                                 :maximum => 5)\n\n\nThe usage of with_tag(), however, is no longer supported. Instead, a\nblock passed to have_tag() will have each matched element successively\nyielded to it. If none of the blocks return without raising an\nExpectationNotMetError, the outer have_tag() is treated as having failed:\n\n    body.should have_tag('thead') do |thead|\n      thead.should have_tag('th', :count => 5)\n    end\n\nThis also allows arbitrary expectations to be applied from within\nthe block, such as:\n\n    body.should have_tag('dl dd.sha1') do |dd|\n      dd.inner_text.length.should == 40\n    end\n\n\n== Notes\n\nCurrently, this implementation does not support substitution values\nas assert_select did (by way of HTML::Selector):\n\n    # Not yet supported:\n    body.should have_tag('li[class=?]', dom_class)\n    body.should have_tag('tr.person#?', /^person-\\d+$/)\n\nI personally rarely use these, and Hpricot's advanced selectors make\nthem mostly useless, as far as I can tell, so I am unlikely to\nimplement them myself.\n\nThis have_tag() further differs from the assert_select-based\nimplementation in that the nested have_tag() calls must *all* pass\non a single selected element in order to be true. This was a source\nof confusion in RSpec ticket #316. There is a spec covering this\ncase if you need an example.\n\n",

    "Readme": "This module defines an FSA class, for representing and operating on\nfinite-state automata (FSAs). FSAs can be used to represent regular\nexpressions and to test sequences for membership in the languages\ndescribed by regular expressions.\n\nFSAs can be deterministic or nondeterministic, and they can contain\nepsilon transitions. Methods to determinize an automaton (also\neliminating its epsilon transitions), and to minimize an automaton,\nare provided.\n\nThe transition labels for an FSA can be symbols from an alphabet, as\nin the standard formal definition of an FSA, but they can also be\ninstances which represent predicates. If these instances implement\ninstance.matches(), then the FSA nextState() function and accepts()\npredicate can be used. If they implement instance.complement() and\ninstance.intersection(), the FSA can be be determinized and minimized,\nto find a minimal deterministic FSA that accepts an equivalent\nlanguage.\n\n\nQuick Start\n----------\nInstances of FSA can be created out of labels (for instance, strings)\nby the singleton() function, and combined to create more complex FSAs\nthrough the complement(), closure(), concatenation(), union(), and\nother constructors. For example, concatenation(singleton('a'),\nunion(singleton('b'), closure(singleton('c')))) creates an FSA that\naccepts the strings 'a', 'ab', 'ac', 'acc', 'accc', and so on.\n\nInstances of FSA can also be created with the compileRE() function,\nwhich compiles a simple regular expression (using only '*', '?', '+',\n'|', '(', and ')' as metacharacters) into an FSA. For example,\ncompileRE('a(b|c*)') returns an FSA equivalent to the example in the\nprevious paragraph.\n\nFSAs can be determinized, to create equivalent FSAs (FSAs accepting\nthe same language) with unique successor states for each input, and\nminimized, to create an equivalent deterministic FSA with the smallest\nnumber of states. FSAs can also be complemented, intersected, unioned,\nand so forth as described under 'FSA Functions' below.\n\n\nFSA Methods\n-----------\nThe class FSA defines the following methods.\n\nAcceptance\n``````````\nfsa.nextStates(state, input)\n  returns a list of states\nfsa.nextState(state, input)\n  returns None or a single state if\n  |nextStates| <= 1, otherwise it raises an exception\nfsa.nextStateSet(states, input)\n  returns a list of states\nfsa.accepts(sequence)\n  returns true or false\n\nAccessors and predicates\n````````````````````````\nisEmpty()\n  returns true iff the language accepted by the FSA is the empty language\nlabels()\n  returns a list of labels that are used in any transition\nnextAvailableState()\n  returns an integer n such that no states in the FSA\n  are numeric values >= n\n\nReductions\n``````````\nsorted(initial=0)\n  returns an equivalent FSA whose states are numbered\n  upwards from 0\ndeterminized()\n  returns an equivalent deterministic FSA\nminimized()\n  returns an equivalent minimal FSA\ntrimmed()\n  returns an equivalent FSA that contains no unreachable or dead\n  states\n\nPresentation\n````````````\ntoDotString()\n  returns a string suitable as *.dot file for the 'dot'\n  program from AT&T GraphViz\nview()\n  views the FSA with a gs viewer, if gs and dot are installed\n\n\nFSA Functions\n------------\nConstruction from FSAs\n``````````````````````\ncomplement(a)\n  returns an fsa that accepts exactly those sequences that its\n  argument does not\nclosure(a)\n  returns an fsa that accepts sequences composed of zero or more\n  concatenations of sequences accepted by the argument\nconcatenation(a, b)\n  returns an fsa that accepts sequences composed of a\n  sequence accepted by a, followed by a sequence accepted by b\ncontainment(a, occurrences=1)\n  returns an fsa that accepts sequences that\n  contain at least occurrences occurrences of a subsequence recognized by the\n  argument.\ndifference(a, b)\n  returns an fsa that accepts those sequences accepted by a\n  but not b\nintersection(a, b)\n  returns an fsa that accepts sequences accepted by both a\n  and b\niteration(a, min=1, max=None)\n  returns an fsa that accepts sequences\n  consisting of from min to max (or any number, if max is None) of sequences\n  accepted by its first argument\noption(a)\n  equivalent to union(a, EMPTY_STRING_FSA)\nreverse(a)\n  returns an fsa that accepts strings whose reversal is accepted by\n  the argument\nunion(a, b)\n  returns an fsa that accepts sequences accepted by both a and b\n\nPredicates\n``````````\nequivalent(a, b)\n  returns true iff a and b accept the same language\n\nReductions (these equivalent to the similarly-named methods)\n````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````\ndeterminize(fsa)\n  returns an equivalent deterministic FSA\nminimize(fsa)\n  returns an equivalent minimal FSA\nsort(fsa, initial=0)\n  returns an equivalent FSA whose states are numbered from\n  initial\ntrim(fsa)\n  returns an equivalent FSA that contains no dead or unreachable\n  states\n\nConstruction from labels\n````````````````````````\ncompileRE(string)\n  returns an FSA that accepts the language described by\n  string, where string is a list of symbols and '*', '+', '?', and '|' operators,\n    with '(' and ')' to control precedence.\nsequence(sequence)\n  returns an fsa that accepts sequences that are matched by\n  the elements of the argument. For example, sequence('abc') returns an fsa that\n  accepts 'abc' and ['a', 'b', 'c'].\nsingleton(label)\n  returns an fsa that accepts singletons whose elements are\n  matched by label. For example, singleton('a') returns an fsa that accepts only\n  the string 'a'.\n\n\nFSA Constants\n------------\nEMPTY_STRING_FSA is an FSA that accepts the language consisting only\nof the empty string.\n\nNULL_FSA is an FSA that accepts the null language.\n\nUNIVERSAL_FSA is an FSA that accepts S*, where S is any object.\n\n\nFSA instance creation\n---------------------\nFSA is initialized with a list of states, an alphabet, a list of\ntransition, an initial state, and a list of final states. If fsa is an\nFSA, fsa.tuple() returns these values in that order, i.e. (states,\nalphabet, transitions, initialState, finalStates). They're also\navailable as fields of fsa with those names.\n\nEach element of transition is a tuple of a start state, an end state,\nand a label: (startState, endSTate, label).\n\nIf the list of states is None, it's computed from initialState,\nfinalStates, and the states in transitions.\n\nIf alphabet is None, an open alphabet is used: labels are assumed to\nbe objects that implements label.matches(input), label.complement(),\nand label.intersection() as follows:\n\n    - label.matches(input) returns true iff label matches input\n    - label.complement() returnseither a label or a list of labels which,\n        together with the receiver, partition the input alphabet\n    - label.intersection(other) returns either None (if label and other don't\n        both match any symbol), or a label that matches the set of symbols that\n        both label and other match\n\nAs a special case, strings can be used as labels. If a strings 'a' and\n'b' are used as a label and there's no alphabet, '~a' and '~b' are\ntheir respective complements, and '~a&~b' is the intersection of '~a'\nand '~b'. (The intersections of 'a' and 'b', 'a' and '~b', and '~a'\nand 'b' are, respectively, None, 'a', and 'b'.)\n\n\nGoals\n-----\nDesign Goals:\n\n- easy to use\n- easy to read (simple implementation, direct expression of algorithms)\n- extensible\n\nNon-Goals:\n\n- efficiency\n\n",

    "Readme": "Stickshift is a simple, manual-instrumenting call-tree profiler in as\nfew lines of code as possible.\nBackground\nThe idea is to be as minimally intrusive as possible, but also to be\nstupid simple and manual. You tell stickshift to only instrument the\nmethods you want, and it measures time spent in that method, as well\nas any time spent in any instrumented methods invoked by the method.\nAfter leaving the top-most method, a call tree with timings is dumped\nto $stdout.\nNote: You aren't allowed to instrument methods on the String class, or\nany object's #inspect method, because it can generate a recursive\nloop! For fine-grained profiling on any arbitrary class, use profiler\nor ruby-prof instead. You're also not allowed to instrument an\ninstrumented method.\nExample\nConsider the following Rakefile:\ntask :sleep => :snooze do\n  sleep 1\nend\ntask :snooze do\n  sleep 2\nend\ntask :default => :sleep\n\nrequire 'stickshift'\n::Rake::Application.instrument :top_level\n::Rake::Application.instrument :[], :with_args => 0\n::Rake::Task.instrument :invoke, :execute, :inspect_self => true\n\nRunning 'rake' will produce the following output. Method self time is\nshown along the left, while method total time is at the end of each\nline.\n   0ms >  Rake::Application#top_level < 3001ms\n   0ms >    Rake::Application#[](\"default\") < 0ms\n   0ms >    Rake::Task#invoke{<Rake::Task default => [sleep]>} < 3001ms\n   0ms >      Rake::Application#[](\"sleep\") < 0ms\n   0ms >      Rake::Application#[](\"snooze\") < 0ms\n2000ms >      Rake::Task#execute{<Rake::Task snooze => []>} < 2000ms\n1000ms >      Rake::Task#execute{<Rake::Task sleep => [snooze]>} < 1000ms\n   0ms >      Rake::Task#execute{<Rake::Task default => [sleep]>} < 0ms\n\nInstrumentation\nStickshift adds a method named #instrument to the Module class that\ninstruments methods in the receiver module or class.\nIt accepts one or more method names, and an optional trailing hash of\noptions:\n\n:label => \"label\" gives the instrumented method a custom label\ninstead of the default \"Class#method\" label.\n:with_args => 0 causes the first argument to the method to be\nincluded in the label. Ranges can also be used.\n:inspect_self => true causes the inspected object to be printed in\nthe label.\n:top_level => true causes Stickshift to only be activated after\npassing through this method. If any other non-top-level instrumented\nmethod is called outside of a top-level method, it will not be timed\nor reported.\n\n#uninstrument and #uninstrument_all methods are also available if\nyou wish to disable instrumentation.\nCapture/Settings\n\nStickshift.enabled (default true) controls whether Stickshift is\non or not.\nStickshift.output (default $stdout) controls where output is\nwritten.

Hits are a raw measure of request traffic for your feed.\n    * Detailed Item Popularity: The popularity of each item published as determined by itemviews and clickthroughs.\n    * Item Syndication: Redisplay or repurposing of a feed's content on a third party website that generates traffic (as itemviews and clickthroughs).\n\nThe reports and charts you see when using The FeedBurner website are based on the same data.

Need to load an additional object for the :show action? Slap another before_filter on it. Need to change the path that the :update action redirects to? Override the :update action with your new rendering behavior.\n\nGenerator\n===========\n\nA resource_this generator is included - does the same thing as the 'resource' generator but adds 'resource_this' to the generated controller.\n\nQuestions?

    "Name": "warbler",
    "Readme": "\nWarbler  \nWarbler is a gem to make a Java jar or war file out of any Ruby, Rails or\nRack application. Warbler provides a minimal, flexible, Ruby-like way to\nbundle up all of your application files for deployment to a Java\nenvironment.\nWarbler provides a sane set of out-of-the box defaults that should allow\nmost Ruby applications to assemble and Just Work.\nVersion 2.x of Warbler supports versions of JRuby from 9.0.0.0 and up.\nVersion 1.4.x of Warbler supports versions of JRuby up to 1.7.x. The 1.x-dev branch is\nthe working code for this.\nGetting Started\n\nInstall the gem: gem install warbler.\n\nRun warbler in the top directory of your application: warble.\n\nChoose one:\n\n\nFor a web project, deploy your myapp.war file to your favorite\nJava application server.\n\nFor a standalone applications, just run it: java -jar myapp.jar.\n\nUsage\nWarbler's warble command is just a small wrapper around Rake\nwith internally defined tasks.\n$ warble -T\nwarble compiled    # Feature: precompile all Ruby files\nwarble config      # Generate a configuration file to customize your archive\nwarble executable  # Feature: make an executable archive (runnable + an emb...\nwarble gemjar      # Feature: package gem repository inside a jar\nwarble pluginize   # Install Warbler tasks in your Rails application\nwarble runnable    # Feature: make a runnable archive (e.g. java -jar rails...\nwarble version     # Display version of Warbler\nwarble war         # Create the project war file\nwarble war:clean   # Remove the project war file\nwarble war:debug   # Dump diagnostic information\nType warble to create the jar or war file.\nFeatures\nWarbler \u201cfeatures\u201d are small Rake tasks that run before the creation of the\nwar file and make manipulations to the archive structure. For instance, the\nexecutable feature makes your war file capable of running on its\nown, without a servlet container (using an embedded web server) :\nwarble executable war\nYou can either add features to the warbler command line:\nwarble FEATURE war\nor configure them in config/warble.rb to always be used.\nconfig.features = %w(FEATURE)\nCurrently, the following features are available :\n\ngemjar: This bundles all gems into a single gem file to reduce the\nnumber of files in the .war. This is mostly useful for Google AppEngine\nwhere the number of files per application has a limit. (Note: not\napplicable for jar-based applications.)\n\nrunnable: This makes a (standard Java) runnable .war archive thus\nyou can execute binary bundled (gem) commands e.g. \u201crake\u201d. You should use\nthe -S switch to specify the binary followed by any arguments in takes e.g.\njava -jar myrailsapp.war -S rake db:migrate.\n\nexecutable: This bundles an embedded web server into the .war so\nthat it can either be deployed into a traditional java web server or run as\na standalone application using java -jar myapp.war. (Note:\njar-based applications are executable by default.)\n\ncompiled: This uses jrubyc to precompile all .rb files in\nyour application to .class files and includes those in the .war instead of\nthe Ruby sources. NOTE: The war file will still contain .rb files, but they\nwill be short stubs containing the following code : load\n__FILE__.sub(/\\.rb$/, '.class')\n\nFeatures may form the basis for a third-party plugin system (in the future)\nif there is demand.\nNOTE: Feature tasks must be included in the same command invocation and\ninserted before the war task in order to take effect. For example,\nwarble compiled; warble war does not compile and obfuscate\n.rb sources because the second invocation of warble does\nnot run the compiled feature and creates a basic war with the\nsources included, make sure you run :\nwarble compiled war\nor, if it's important that the war always be compiled, use the option\nabove to put the feature in your config/warble.rb.\nWar or Jar?\nWar-based projects are for Rails, Merb, or Rack-based web applications.\nThey usually contain a config/environment.rb file, a\nconfig/init.rb file, or a config.ru file. The presence of\nthese files are used to determine if the project is a web application, and\nthus a Java EE compatible war file is built for the project.\nJar-based projects are for standalone Ruby applications. Usually a Ruby\napplication has a launcher script in the bin directory and Ruby\ncode in the lib directory. Warbler packages the application so\nthat java -jar myapp.jar runs the launcher script.\nJar Files\nGem Specification (gemspec) Files\nIf your project has a .gemspec file in the top directory, it will\nbe used to configure the project's dependencies, launcher script,\nrequire paths, and the files to be included in the archive. For best\nresults make sure your gemspec specifies all of the following attributes:\n\nexecutables\n\nrequire_paths\n\nruntime dependencies added with add_dependency\n\nIf your project do not have a .gemspec, Warbler will attempt to\nguess the launcher from the contents of the bin directory and use\nthe lib directory as the lone require path. All files in the\nproject will be included in the archive.\nBundler\nApplications that use Bundler,\ndetected via presence of a Gemfile, will have the gems packaged up\ninto the archive along with the Gemfile. The Bundler groups named\n\u201c:development\u201d, \u201c:test\u201d and \u201c:assets\u201d will be excluded by default, unless\nyou specify with config.bundle_without in\nconfig/warble.rb.\nWarbler supports Bundler for gems and git repositories, but not for plain\npath components. Warbler will warn when a :path component is found\nin the Gemfile and will refuse to include it in the archive.\nJBundler (experimental)\nApplications that use JBundler, detected via\npresence of a Jarfile, will have the jars packaged up into the\narchive. the JBundler gem is *not* needed for runtime since all jars\nare already part of the classloader.\nWar Files\nRails applications\nRails applications are detected automatically and configured appropriately.\nThe following items are set up for you:\n\nYour application runs in the production environment by default.\nChange it in config/warble.rb (see below).\n\nThe Rails gem is packaged if you haven't vendored Rails (Rails <=\n2.x).\n\nOther gems configured in Rails.configuration.gems are packaged (2.1 - 2.3)\n\nMulti-thread-safe execution (as introduced in Rails 2.2) is detected and\nruntime pooling is disabled.\n\nOther Rack-based applications\nIf you have a config.ru file in the top directory or one of the\nimmediate subdirectories of your application, it will be included and used\nas the rackup script for your Rack-based application. You will probably\nneed to specify framework and application gems in config/warble.rb\nunless you're using Bundler to manage your gems.\nENV['RACK_ENV'] will be set to production.\nSee the\nexamples in the jruby-rack project of how to configure Warbler to\npackage Camping and Sinatra apps.\nConfiguration auto-detect notes\n\nWarbler will load the environment Rake task in a Rails application\nto try to detect some configuration. If you don't have database access\nin the environment where you package your application, you may wish to set\nWarbler.framework_detection = false at the top of\nconfig.rb. In this case you may need to specify additional details\nsuch as booter, gems and other settings that would normally be gleaned from\nthe app configuration.\n\nIs it possible to more generally detect what gems an application uses?\nGem.loaded_specs is available, but the application needs to be\nloaded first before its contents are reliable.\n\nCustom configuration\nIf the default settings are not appropriate for your application, you can\ncustomize Warbler's behavior. To customize files, libraries, and gems\nincluded in the .war file, you'll need a config/warble.rb file. There a\ntwo ways of doing this. With the gem, simply run\nwarble config\nFinally, edit the config/warble.rb to your taste. The generated\nfile is fully-documented with the available options and default values.\nWar layout\nThe default configuration puts application files (app,\nconfig, lib, log, vendor, tmp)\nunder the .war file's WEB-INF directory, and files in\npublic in the root of the .war file. Any Java .jar files stored in\nlib will automatically be placed in WEB-INF/lib for placement on\nthe web app's class-path.\nWeb.xml\nJava web applications are configured mainly through this file, and Warbler\ncreates a suitable default file for you for use. However, if you need to\ncustomize it in any way, you have two options.\n\nIf you just want a static web.xml file whose contents you manually control,\nyou may unzip the one generated for you in\nyourapp.war:WEB-INF/web.xml to config/web.xml and modify\nas needed. It will be copied into subsequent copies of the war file for\nyou.\n\nIf you want to inject some dynamic information into the file, copy the\nWARBLER_HOME/web.xml.erb to config/web.xml.erb. Its\ncontents will be evaluated for you and put in the webapp. Note that you can\nalso pass arbitrary properties to the ERb template by setting\nconfig.webxml.customkey values in your config/warble.rb\nfile.\n\nFor more information on configuration, see Warbler::Config.\nRakefile integration\nIf you'd like to control Warbler from your own project's\nRakefile, simply add the following code somewhere in the\nRakefile :\nrequire 'warbler'\nWarbler::Task.new\nIf you're using Bundler, you'll want to add Warbler to your\nGemfile :\ngroup :development do\n  gem \"warbler\", :require => false\nend\nNow you should be able to invoke rake war to create your war file.\nRuby 1.8 compatibility\nWarbler supports versions of JRuby that support Ruby 1.8, so Warbler itself\ncontinues to support Ruby 1.8. However, many gems are choosing to drop 1.8\nsupport; one of these gems is {rubyzip}(github.com/rubyzip/rubyzip),\nwhich Warbler relies on. If you need to use Warbler in a 1.8 environment,\nyou will need to lock the rubyzip gem to a version before 1.0.0.\nTroubleshooting\nIf Warbler isn't packaging the files you were expecting, use the\n+war:debug+ task to give you more insight into what's going on.\nIf you think you found a bug, please file one at github.com/jruby/warbler/issues.\nSource\nYou can get the Warbler source using Git, in any of the following ways:\ngit clone git://git.caldersphere.net/warbler.git\ngit clone git://github.com/jruby/warbler.git\nYou can also download a tarball of Warbler source at github.com/jruby/warbler/tarball/master.\nDevelopment\nYou can develop Warbler with any implementation of Ruby. To write Warbler\ncode and run specs, you need to have Bundler installed and run\nbundle once.\nAfter that, simply run rake.\nIntegration Tests\nThere are a few integration tests in the `integration` directory that build\nWAR file with Warbler, and run some basic smoke tests against them.  You\ncan run these like so:\ncd integration\nexport MAVEN_OPTS=\"-XX:MaxPermSize=128m\"\nmvn verify\nThe increased PermGen space is for the Rails4 test. And You'll need to\nhave Maven 3.1.1 installed, of course: maven.apache.org/ Be aware the homebrew\ninstalls 3.0.5, which doesn't work (and I don't really know why).\nLicense\nWarbler is provided under the terms of the MIT license.\nWarbler \u00a9 2013-2015 The JRuby project\nWarbler \u00a9 2010-2012 Engine Yard, Inc.\nWarbler \u00a9 2007-2009 Sun Microsystems, Inc.\n",

    "Readme": "CI::Reporter is an add-on to Ruby testing frameworks like Test::Unit\nor RSpec that allows you to generate XML reports of your test\nruns. The resulting files can be read by a continuous integration\nsystem that understands Ant's JUnit report XML format, thus allowing\nyour CI system to track test/spec successes and failures.\n\n\n\n\nUsage\nCI::Reporter works with projects that use standard Rake tasks for\nrunning tests. In this fashion, it hooks into testing frameworks using\nenvironment variables recognized by these custom tasks to inject the\nCI::Reporter code into the test run.\nEach supported testing framework is provided by a separate gem:\n\nCucumber\nMinitest\nRSpec\nSpinach\nTest::Unit\n\nUpgrading from CI::Reporter 1.x\nCI::Reporter 1.x supported all the different test frameworks in a\nsingle gem. This was convenient, but caused issues as test frameworks\nreleased new, sometimes incompatibile, versions. CI::Reporter 2.x has\nbeen split into multiple gems, allowing each gem to specify the test\nframework versions it supports.\nTo upgrade to 2.x, remove ci_reporter from your Gemfile and replace\nit with one or more of the framework-specific gems above.\nJenkins setup\n\nAdd the \"Publish JUnit test result report\" post-build step\nin the job configuration.\nEnter \"test/reports/*.xml,spec/reports/*.xml\" in the \"Test report\nXMLs\" field (adjust this to suit which tests you are running)\n\nReport files are written, by default, to the\ntest/reports, features/reports or\nspec/reports subdirectory of your project.  If you wish\nto customize the location, simply set the environment variable\nCI_REPORTS (either in the environment, on the Rake command line, or in\nyour Rakefile) to the location where they should go.\nConditional reporting\nYou may not wish to always produce report files. There are two primary\nways to configure this:\nWith environment variables\nUse an environment variable in your Rakefile to control if CI:Reporter\nwill be invoked:\nif ENV['GENERATE_REPORTS'] == 'true'\n  require 'ci/reporter/rake/rspec'\n  task :rspec => 'ci:setup:rspec'\nend\nYou can either inject this variable in your CI or simply call rake\nwith the environment variable set:\nGENERATE_REPORTS=true rake rspec\n\nWith CI-specific Rake tasks\nInstead of modifying your existing Rake tasks, create new ones:\nnamespace :ci do\n  task :all => ['ci:setup:rspec', 'rspec']\nend\nThen use this Rake target in CI:\nrake ci:all\n\nEnvironment Variables\n\nCI_REPORTS: if set, points to a directory where report files will\nbe written.\nCI_CAPTURE: if set to value \"off\", stdout/stderr capture will be\ndisabled.\n\n",

    "Name": "spatial_adapter2",
    "Readme": "=Spatial Adapter for Rails\nThis is the Spatial Adapter for Rails 0.1.1. It is a plugin for Rails which manages the MySql Spatial and PostGIS geometric columns in a transparent way (that is like the other base data type columns). It also provides a way to manage these columns in migrations. It replaces both the \"PostGIS Adapter for Rails\" and \"MySql Spatial Adapter for Rails\" plugins.\n\n===Dependencies\nYou need to install a version >= 0.1.1 of the GeoRuby gem (http://rubyforge.org/projects/georuby/) :\n    gem install georuby\n\n\n===Installation\nAt the root of your Rails project, type :\n       script\\plugin install svn://rubyforge.org/var/svn/georuby/SpatialAdapter/trunk/spatial_adapter\nYou need to have SVN installed.\n\n\n===Operations\nGeometric columns in your ActiveRecord models now appear just like any other column of other basic data types. They can also be dumped in ruby schema mode and loaded in migrations the same way as columns of basic types.\n\n==== Migrations\n\nHere is an example of code for the creation of a table with a geometric column in PostGIS, along with the addition of a spatial index on the column : \n    ActiveRecord::Schema.define do\n      create_table \"table_points\", :force => true do |t|\n            t.column \"data\", :string\n            t.column \"geom\", :point, :null=>false, :srid => 123, :with_z => true\n      end\n\n      add_index \"table_points\", \"geom\", :spatial=>true\n        end\n\nHere is a related statement valid for MySql version <= 5.0.16 :\n    ActiveRecord::Schema.define do\n      create_table \"table_points\", ;options=>\"ENGINE=MyISAM\", :force => true do |t|\n            t.column \"data\", :string\n            t.column \"geom\", :point, :null=>false\n      end\n\n      add_index \"table_points\", \"geom\", :spatial=>true\n        end\nThe differences with the PostGIS version are because of the following reasons :\n- On all version of MySql, the :srid and :with_z would be ignored, since they are not supported.\n- On MySql versions <= 5.0.16, you have to add <tt>:options => \"ENGINE=MyISAM\"</tt> to the create_table statetement, since only MyISAM tables can have geometric columns.\n\n==== Model\n\nHere is the model you would use, in both MySql and PostGIS:\n    class TablePoint < ActiveRecord::Base\n    end\nThat was easy! As you see, there is no need to declare a column as geometric. The plugin will get this information by itself.\n\n==== Access\n\nHere is an example of PostGIS row creation and access, using the model and the table defined above :\n    pt = TablePoint.new(:data => \"Hello!\",:geom => Point.from_x_y_z(-1.6,2.8,-3.4,123))\n    pt.save\n    pt = TablePoint.find_first\n    puts pt.geom.x #access the geom column like any other\n\nFor MySQL, it is slightly different since it does not support Z dimension or SRID :\n    pt = TablePoint.new(:data => \"Hello!\",:geom => Point.from_x_y(-1.6,2.8))\n    pt.save\n    pt = TablePoint.find_first\n    puts pt.geom.x #access the geom column like any other\n\n==== Fixtures\n\nIf you use fixtures for your unit tests, at some point, you will want to input a geometry. You could transform your geometries to a form suitable for YAML yourself everytime but the spatial adapter provides a method to do it for you: +to_yaml+. It works for both MySQL and PostGIS (although the string returned is different for each database). You would use it like this, if the geometric column is a point:\n    fixture:\n     id: 1\n     data: HELLO\n     geom: <%= Point.from_x_y(123.5,321.9).to_yaml %>\n\n==== Find_by\n\nfind_by_[column] has been redefined when column is of a geometric type. Instead of using the Rails default '=' operator, for which I can't see a definition for MySql spatial datatypes and which performs a bounding box equality test in PostGIS, it uses a bounding box intersection: && in PostGIS and MBRIntersects in MySQL, which can both make use of a spatial index if one is present to speed up the queries. You could use this query, for example, if you need to display data from the database: You would want only the geometries which are in the screen rectangle and you could use a bounding box query for that. Since this is a common case, it is the default. You have 2 ways to use the find_by_[geom_column]: Either by passing a geometric object directly, or passing an array with the 2 opposite corners of a bounding box (with 2 or 3 coordinates depending of the dimension of the data).\n    Park.find_by_geom(LineString.from_coordinates([[1.4,5.6],[2.7,8.9],[1.6,5.6]]))\nor\n    Park.find_by_geom([[3,5.6],[19.98,5.9]])\nIn PostGIS, since you can only use operations with geometries with the same SRID, you can add a third element representing the SRID of the bounding box to the array. It is by default set to -1:\n    Park.find_by_geom([[3,5.6],[19.98,5.9],123])\n\n==== Geometric data types\n\nRuby geometric datatypes are currently made available only through the GeoRuby library (http://thepochisuperstarmegashow.com/ProjectsDoc/georuby-doc/index.html): This is where the <tt>Point.from_x_y</tt> in the example above comes from. It is a goal of a future release of the Spatial Adapter to support additional geometric datatype libraries, such as Ruby/GEOS, as long as they can support reading and writing of EWKB.\n\n\n===Warning\n- If you use a version of MySQL before 5.0.16, only tables using the MyISAM engine can support geometric columns. After MySQL 5.0.16, any engine (incuding INNODB) is supported. \n\n- Since ActiveRecord seems to keep only the string values directly returned from the database, it translates from these to the correct types everytime an attribute is read, which is probably ok for simple types, but might be less than efficient for geometries, since the EWKB string has to be parsed everytime. Also it means you cannot modify the geometry object returned from an attribute directly :\n       place = Place.find_first\n       place.the_geom.y=123456.7\n\n- Since the translation to a geometry is performed everytime the_geom is read, the change to y will not be saved! You would have to do something like this :    \n       place = Place.find_first\n       the_geom = place.the_geom\n       the_geom.y=123456.7\n       place.the_geom = the_geom\n\n\n===Changes since last version\n- The PostGIS adapter and the MySql Spatial adapter have been merged into one plugin. The correct files to load is determined using the type of connection defined in the environment.\n- Geometric columns can now be dumped just like other base data types. This means you can use the ruby schema mode, even if you use the plugin.\n- Support of M dimensions in migrations. The <tt>:dimension</tt> key in the column definition has disappeared and has been replaced by <tt>:with_z</tt> and <tt>:with_m</tt>.\n- Addition of unit tests. At the plugin root, Run <tt>rake test:mysql</tt> to run the mysql tests and <tt>rake test:postgis</tt> for the postgis ones. You will need to configure your connection in <tt>test/db/database_mysql.yml</tt> and <tt>test/db/database_postgis.yml</tt>. If you get errors on your platform, please report to mailto:guilhem.vellut+georuby@gmail.com.\n- Addition of a find_by methods with a special behaviour for geometries\n- Addition of a to_yaml method to use inside a YAML fixture\n\n===TODO\n- Support of other geometric datatype libraries in addition to GeoRuby\n- Tutorials\n\n===License\nThe Spatial Adapter for Rails is released under the MIT license.\n\n===Support\nAny questions, enhancement proposals, bug notifications or corrections can be sent to mailto:guilhem.vellut+georuby@gmail.com.\n",

However, it  supports, or aims to support, all\nthe Atom Syndication Format and Publication Protocol and can be used to\naccess Atom feeds or to script publishing entries to a blog supporting APP.\n\nAPI docs are here.\nPrerequisites\n\nlibxml-ruby, >= 1.1.2\n\nrspec (Only required for tests)\n\nlibxml-ruby in turn requires the libxml2 library to be installed. libxml2\ncan be downloaded from xmlsoft.org/downloads.html or\ninstalled using whatever tools are provided by your platform.  At least\nversion 2.6.31 is required.\nMac OSX\nMac OSX by default comes with an old version of libxml2 that will not work\nwith rAtom. You will need to install a more recent version.  If you are\nusing Macports:\nport install libxml2\nAlternatively, using Homebrew:\nbrew install libxml2\nInstallation\nYou can install via gem using:\ngem install ratom\nUsage\nTo fetch a parse an Atom Feed you can simply:\nrequire 'atom'\n\nfeed = Atom::Feed.load_feed(URI.parse(\"http://example.com/feed.atom\"))\nAnd then iterate over the entries in the feed using:\nfeed.each_entry do |entry|\n  # do cool stuff\nend\nTo construct the following example Feed is from the Atom spec:\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?>\n<feed xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom\">\n\n  <title>Example Feed</title> \n  <link href=\"http://example.org/\"/>\n  <updated>2003-12-13T18:30:02Z</updated>\n  <author> \n    <name>John Doe</name>\n  </author> \n  <id>urn:uuid:60a76c80-d399-11d9-b93C-0003939e0af6</id>\n\n  <entry>\n    <title>Atom-Powered Robots Run Amok</title>\n    <link href=\"http://example.org/2003/12/13/atom03\"/>\n    <id>urn:uuid:1225c695-cfb8-4ebb-aaaa-80da344efa6a</id>\n    <updated>2003-12-13T18:30:02Z</updated>\n    <summary>Some text.</summary>\n  </entry>\n\n</feed>\nTo build this in rAtom we would do:\nfeed = Atom::Feed.new do |f|\n  f.title = \"Example Feed\"\n  f.links << Atom::Link.new(:href => \"http://example.org/\")\n  f.updated = Time.parse('2003-12-13T18:30:02Z')\n  f.authors << Atom::Person.new(:name => 'John Doe')\n  f.id = \"urn:uuid:60a76c80-d399-11d9-b93C-0003939e0af6\"\n  f.entries << Atom::Entry.new do |e|\n    e.title = \"Atom-Powered Robots Run Amok\"\n    e.links << Atom::Link.new(:href => \"http://example.org/2003/12/13/atom03\")\n    e.id = \"urn:uuid:1225c695-cfb8-4ebb-aaaa-80da344efa6a\"\n    e.updated = Time.parse('2003-12-13T18:30:02Z')\n    e.summary = \"Some text.\"\n  end\nend\nTo output the Feed as XML use to_xml\n> puts feed.to_xml\n<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<feed xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom\">\n  <id>urn:uuid:60a76c80-d399-11d9-b93C-0003939e0af6</id>\n  <title>Example Feed</title>\n  <updated>2003-12-13T18:30:02Z</updated>\n  <link href=\"http://example.org/\"/>\n  <author>\n    <name>John Doe</name>\n  </author>\n  <entry>\n    <title>Atom-Powered Robots Run Amok</title>\n    <id>urn:uuid:1225c695-cfb8-4ebb-aaaa-80da344efa6a</id>\n    <summary>Some text.</summary>\n    <updated>2003-12-13T18:30:02Z</updated>\n    <link href=\"http://example.org/2003/12/13/atom03\"/>\n  </entry>\n</feed>\nSee Feed and Entry for details on the methods and attributes of those\nclasses.\nPublishing\nTo publish to a remote feed using the Atom Publishing Protocol, first you\nneed to create a collection to publish to:\nrequire 'atom/pub'\n\ncollection = Atom::Pub::Collection.new(:href => 'http://example.org/myblog')\nThen create a new entry\nentry = Atom::Entry.new do |entry|\n  entry.title = \"I have discovered rAtom\"\n  entry.authors << Atom::Person.new(:name => 'A happy developer')\n  entry.updated = Time.now\n  entry.id = \"http://example.org/myblog/newpost\"\n  entry.content = Atom::Content::Html.new(\"<p>rAtom lets me post to my blog using Ruby, how cool!</p>\")\nend\nAnd publish it to the Collection:\npublished_entry = collection.publish(entry)\nPublish returns an updated entry filled out with any attributes to server\nmay have set, including information required to let us update to the entry.\nFor example, lets change the content and republished:\npublished_entry.content =  Atom::Content::Html.new(\"<p>rAtom lets me post to and edit my blog using Ruby, how cool!</p>\")\npublished_entry.updated = Time.now\npublished_entry.save!\nTo update an existing Entry:\nexisting_entry = Entry.load_entry(URI.parse(\"http://example.org/afeedentry.atom\"))\n\nexisting_entry.title = \"I have discovered rAtom\"\nexisting_entry.updated = Time.now\nexisting_entry.save!\nYou can also delete an entry using the destroy! method, but we\nwon't do that will we?.\nExtension elements\nAs of version 0.3.0, rAtom support simple extension elements on feeds and\nentries.  As defined in the Atom Syndication Format, simple extension\nelements consist of XML elements from a non-Atom namespace that have no\nattributes or child elements, i.e. they are empty or only contain text\ncontent.  These elements are treated as a name value pair where the element\nnamespace and local name make up the key and the content of the element is\nthe value, empty elements will be treated as an empty string.\nTo access extension elements use the [] method on the Feed or Entry. For\nexample, if we are parsing the follow Atom document with extensions:\n<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<feed xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom\" xmlns:ex=\"http://example.org\">\n  <title>Feed with extensions</title>\n  <ex:myelement>Something important</ex:myelement>\n</feed>\nWe could then access the extension element on the feed using:\n> feed[\"http://example.org\", \"myelement\"]\n=> [\"Something important\"]\nNote that the return value is an array. This is because XML allows multiple\ninstances of the element.\nTo set an extension element you append to the array:\n> feed['http://example.org', 'myelement'] << 'Something less important'\n=> [\"Something important\", \"Something less important\"]\nYou can then call to_xml and rAtom will serialize the extension elements\ninto xml.\n> puts feed.to_xml\n<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<feed xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom\">\n  <myelement xmlns=\"http://example.org\">Something important</myelement>\n  <myelement xmlns=\"http://example.org\">Something less important</myelement>\n</feed>\nNotice that the output repeats the xmlns attribute for each of the\nextensions, this is semantically the same the input XML, just a bit ugly. \nIt seems to be a limitation of the libxml-Ruby API. But if anyone knows a\nwork around I'd gladly accept a patch (or even advice).\nCustom Extension Classes \nAs of version 0.5.0 you can also define your own classes for a extension\nelements.  This is done by first creating an alias for the namespace for\nthe class and then using the element method on the Atom::Feed or\nAtom::Entry class to tell rAtom to use your custom class when it encounters\nthe extension element.\nFor example, say we have the following piece Atom XML with a structured\nextension element:\n<?xml version='1.0' encoding='UTF-8'?>\n<entry xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom' xmlns:custom='http://custom.namespace'>\n  <id>https://custom.namespace/id/1</id>\n  <link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://custom.namespace/id/1'/>\n  <custom:property name='foo' value='bar'/>\n  <custom:property name='baz' value='bat'/>\n</entry>\nAnd we want the +custom:property+ elements to be parsed as our own custom\nclass called Custom::Property that is defined like this:\nclass Custom::Property\n  attr_accessor :name, :value\n  def initialize(xml)\n    # Custom XML handling\n  end\nend\nWe can tell rAtom about our custom namespace and custom class using the\nfollowing method calls:\nAtom::Entry.add_extension_namespace :custom, \"http://custom.namespace\"\nAtom::Entry.elements \"custom:property\", :class => Custom::Property\nThe first method call registers an alias for the \u201ccustom.namespace\u201d namespace and the\nsecond method call tell rAtom that when it encounters a custom:property\nelement within a Feed it should create an instance of Custom::Property and\npass the XML Reader to the constructor of the instance.  It is then up to\nthe constructor to populate the objects attributes  from the XML. Note that\nthe alias you create using add_extension_namespace can be anything\nyou want, it doesn't need to match the alias in the actual XML itself.\nThe custom property will then be available as a method on the rAtom class. \nIn the above example:\n@feed.custom_property.size == 2\n@feed.custom_property.first.name == 'foo'\n@feed.custom_property.first.value == 'bar'\nThere is one caveat to this.  By using this type of extension support you\nare permanently modifying the rAtom classes. So if your application process\none type of atom extension and you are happy with permanently modified\nrAtom classes, the extra extensibility might work for you.  If on the other\nhand you process lots of different types of extension you might want to\nstick with simpler extension mechanism using the [namespace, element]\nmethod described above.\n(Thanks to nachokb for this feature!!)\nBasic Authentication\nAll methods that involve HTTP requests now support HTTP Basic\nAuthentication.  Authentication credentials are passed as :user and :pass\nparameters to the methods that invoke the request. For example you can load\na feed with HTTP Basic Authentication using:\nAtom::Feed.load_entry(URI.parse(\"http://example.org/feed.atom\"), :user => 'username', :pass => 'password')\nLikewise all the Atom Pub methods support similar parameters, for example\nyou can publish an Entry to a Feed with authentication using:\nfeed.publish(entry, :user => 'username', :pass => 'password')\nOr destroy an entry with:\nentry.destroy!(:user => 'username', :pass => 'password')\nrAtom doesn't store these credentials anywhere within the object model\nso you will need to pass them as arguments to every method call that\nrequires them.  This might be a bit of a pain but it does make things\nsimpler and it means that I'm not responsible for protecting your\ncredentials, although if you are using HTTP Basic Authentication there is a\ngood chance your credentials aren't very well protected anyway.\nAuthHMAC authentication\nAs of version 0.5.1 rAtom also support authentication via HMAC request\nsigning using the AuthHMAC\ngem.  This is made available using the :hmac_access_id and :hmac_secret_key\nparameters which can be passed to the same methods as the HTTP Basic\ncredentials support.\nSSL\nAs of version 0.6.9, rAtom supports fetching feeds via https. This is done\nby using URLs with the SSL protocol. Publishing support is still limited to\nhttp, but patches are welcome.\nTODO\n\nSupport partial content responses from the server.\n\nSupport batching of protocol operations.\n\nAll my tests have been against internal systems, I'd really like\nfeedback from those who have tried rAtom using existing blog software that\nsupports APP.\n\nHandle all base uri tests.\n\nAdd slug support.\n\nSource Code\nThe source repository is accessible via GitHub:\ngit clone git://github.com/seangeo/ratom.git\nThe project now uses Bundler for dependency management so, just do\nbundle install\nto get going.\nContact Information\nThe project page is at github.com/seangeo/ratom.

    "Readme": "MigrationConcordance\n====================\n\nby Josh Susser <josh@hasmanythrough.com>\n\nproject page: http://github.com/joshsusser/migration_concordance\nproject repo: git://github.com/joshsusser/migration_concordance.git\n\nThis plugin extends Rails migrations to provide notification when you need to run migrations. It\nwill detect both new migrations and modifications to previously run migrations. It is primarily of\nuse for team development, but is also useful when deploying a release to a new environment to\ndetermine when migrations need to be run. This plugin does not run migrations automatically, but\nwill notify you whenever you need to run them.\n\nTo integrate with your application:\n\n1) Add the following line to the end of your config/environment.rb file:\n\n    puts ActiveRecord::Migrator.check_concordance\n\n2) Add the file db/migration_snapshot.yml to your SCM ignore list (for example, the svn:ignore\nproperty or .gitignore file). Putting the snapshot file under version control defeats the whole\npurpose of this feature.\n\nAny time you load your application's environment, it will indicate whether you need to run\nmigrations to bring your schema into concordance with the migration files. This notification will\nhappen when you run script/server, tests, the console, or any rake task that depends on the\nenvironment. If you want to check on migration status, you can run \"rake environment\" to print the\nnotification.\n\nBackground\n==========\n\nMigrationConcordance works by taking a snapshot of the state of an appliation's migrations every\ntime you run \"rake db:migrate\". It creates a file in db/migration_snapshot.yml that holds a list\nof all current migrations and their MD5 hashes. Therefore, if you migrate to a migration that is\nnot the latest (using rake db:migrate VERSION=<version>), you won't get any more notifications\neven if you aren't on the latest version. It assumes you know what you are doing and won't keep\nnagging you to migrate after you've migrated somewhere already.\n\nCopyright (c) 2008 Josh Susser, released under the MIT license\n\n",

    "Readme": "augment\n    by Phil Hagelberg (c) 2007\n    http://augment.rubyforge.org\n\n== Description\n\nAugment is a framework for gathering metadata from code and displaying\nit. This metadata would include test failures, test coverage levels,\ncomplexity metrics, and others. Display frontends will be pluggable so\nas to interface with many editors.\n\n== Usage\n\nThe +augment+ executable gathers metadata in the form of layers for a\ngiven file via a backend. Some backends gather data for a file other\nthan the original one passed in. (The test backend will store data for\nthe test if you pass in the implementation.)\n\nExample:\n\n$ augment test lib/foo.rb # will store metadata for test/test_foo.rb\n\nYou can also use the +augment+ executable to display stored\nmetadata. The simplest frontend is +color+ which outputs the\nlayers via ANSI color codes to the shell:\n\n$ augment color test/test_foo.rb\n\nMost other frontends are editor-specific.\n\n== Design\n\nAugment is designed to be generalized; if you want to collect\ndifferent kinds of data you can just write a new backend. If you want\nto display the data in an unsupported editor or output format, you can\nwrite a new frontend.\n\n=== Backends\n\nEach backend takes a filename or glob and outputs the metadata about\nthat file into the .augment directory, created in the project root.\nMetadata is stored as layer information in JSON. Each backend also\nneeds an initiator command to kick off the process that gathers the\nmetadata, with the exception of auto-initiating backends like autotest.\n\n=== Frontends\n\nMost frontends are implemented within an editor or IDE. They watch\nthe .augment directory for changes and apply them to the open buffers\nwhen they happen.  The user can choose what augmentations he wants\ndisplayed either globally or on a per-file basis. He can also control\nwhen backend initiators should be started, though usually these will\nbe kicked off automatically upon saving a file.\n\n=== Layers\n\nA layer consists of a single piece of metadata about a file. This is\nexpressed in terms of the range it applies to in the file, its color,\nand the message associated with it.\n\n== Support\n\nBackends:\n\n* Tests (miniunit)\n* Rspec (planned)\n* Heckle (planned)\n* Rcov (planned)\n* Flog (planned)\n* Performance (planned)\n\nFrontends:\n\n* ANSI color codes (for shells)\n* HTML\n* Emacs\n* Textmate (planned)\n* Vim (planned, need help)\n\n== Issues\n\n* A bit short on frontends and backends.\n\n== License\n\nThis is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify it under\nthe terms of the GNU General Public License as published by the Free\nSoftware Foundation; either version 3, or (at your option) any later\nversion.\n\nThis file is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but\nWITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\nMERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

    "Name": "castanaut",
    "Readme": "= Castanaut: Automate your screencasts.\n\n    Author: Joseph Pearson\n    http://gadgets.inventivelabs.com.au/castanaut\n\n== DESCRIPTION:\n\nCastanaut lets you write executable scripts for your screencasts. With a \nsimple dictionary of stage directions, you can create complex interactions \nwith a variety of applications. Currently, and for the foreseeable future, \nCastanaut supports Mac OS X 10.5 only.\n\n== SYNOPSIS:\n\n=== Writing screenplays\n\nYou write your screenplays as Ruby files. Castanaut has been designed to \nread fairly naturally to the non-technical, within Ruby's constraints.\n\nHere's a simple screenplay:\n\n  launch \"Safari\", at(10, 10, 800, 600)\n  type \"http://www.inventivelabs.com.au\"\n  hit Enter\n  pause 2\n  move to(100, 100)\n  move to(200, 100)\n  move to(200, 200)\n  move to(100, 200)\n  move to(100, 100)\n  say \"I drew a square!\"\n\nWith any luck we don't need to explain to you what this screenplay\ndoes. The only thing that might need some explanation is \"say\" -- this has a \nrobotic voice speak the given string. (Also: all numbers are pixel \nco-ordinates).\n\nAbout the robot: no, we don't recommend you use this in real screencasts for\na large audience. Most people find it a little offputting.  \nYou are free to contravene our recommendation though. You\ncan tweak the robot in the Mac OS X Speech Preferences pane.\n\n=== Running your screenplay\n\nSimply give the screenplay to the castanaut command, like this:\n\n  castanaut test.screenplay\n\nThis assumes you have a screenplay file called \"test.screenplay\" in the \ndirectory where you are running the command.\n\nOf course, it isn't always convenient to drop to the terminal to run your\nscreenplay. So there's also a method of executing your screenplays directly.\nYou need to add this line (the \"shebang\" line) at the top of your screenplay:\n\n#!/usr/bin/env castanaut\n\nThen you need to set the screenplay to be executable by running this command\non it:\n\n  chmod a+x test.screenplay\n\nAgain, substitute \"test.screenplay\" for your screenplay's filename.\n\nAt this point, you should be able to double-click the screenplay, or invoke\nit with Quicksilver, or run it any other way that floats your boat.\n\n=== Stopping the screenplay\n\nIf you want to abruptly terminate execution before the end of the screenplay,\nyou just need to run the 'castanaut' command again -- with or without any \narguments.\n\nOf course, that might be easier said than done, if you haven't got full \ncontrol of the mouse or keyboard at the time. One recommendation is to assign\na system hot-key to invoke castanaut. I use a Quicksilver trigger for this,\nassigned to Shift-F1, that calls castanaut. You'll need the full path to\nthe command for this, which is usually /usr/bin/castanaut, but you can check \nit with the following command:\n\n  which \"castanaut\"\n\n\n=== What stage directions can I make?\n\nOut of the box, Castanaut performs mouse actions, keyboard actions,\nrobot speech and application launches.\n\nFor a complete overview of the built-in stage directions, see the \nCastanaut::Movie class.\n\n=== Using plugins\n\nOf course, just using the built-in stage directions is a little bit awkward\nand verbose. Plugins allow you to extend the available dictionary with\nsome additional convenience actions. Typically a plugin is specific to an\napplication.\n\nCastanaut comes with several plugins, including Castanaut::Plugin::Safari for\ninteracting with the contents of web-pages, and Castanaut::Plugin::Ishowu for\nrecording screencasts using the iShowU application from Shiny White Box.\n\nTo use a plugin, simply declare it:\n\n  plugin \"safari\"\n\n  launch \"Safari\", at(32, 32, 800, 600)\n  url \"http://www.google.com\"\n  pause 4\n  move to_element('input[name=\"q\"]')\n  click\n  type \"Castanaut\"\n  move to_element('input[type=\"submit\"]')\n  click\n  pause 4\n  say \"Oh. I was hoping for more results.\"\n\n\nIn the example above, we use the two methods provided by the Safari module:\nurl, which causes Safari to navigate to the given url, and to_element, which\nreturns the co-ordinates of a page element (using CSS selectors) relative to\nthe screen.\n\n=== Creating your own plugins\n\nAdvanced users can create their own plugins. Put them in a directory \ncalled \"plugins\" below the directory containing the screenplays that use\nthe plugin.\n\nTake a look at the plugins that Castanaut comes with for examples on creating\nyour own.\n\n== REQUIREMENTS:\n\n* Mac OS X 10.5\n\nor\n\n* Mac OS X 10.4\n* The Extras Suite application <http://www.kanzu.com/main.html#extrasuites>\n\n== INSTALL:\n\nRun the following command to install Castanaut\n\n  sudo gem install castanaut\n\nIf you're using Mac OS X 10.4 (Tiger) you will also need to download and install the XTool scripting additions.\n\nOnce installed, you should run the following command for two reasons:\n\n  castanaut\n\nReason 1 is to confirm that it is installed correctly. Reason 2 is to set up\nthe permissions on the utility that controls your mouse and keyboard during\nCastanaut movies. You may be asked for a password here.\n\nIf you just see a \"ScreenplayNotFound\" exception here, everything's good.\n\n== LICENSE:\n\nCopyright (C) 2008 Inventive Labs.\n\nReleased under the WTFPL: http://sam.zoy.org/wtfpl.\n\nPortions released under the MIT License.\n\nSee Copyright.txt for full licensing details.\n\n",

    "Readme": "== Utility Belt\n\nby Giles Bowkett (and many others)\n\nhttp://utilitybelt.rubyforge.org\n\n== DESCRIPTION\n\nUtility Belt is a grab-bag of tricks, tools, techniques, trifles, and toys for IRB, including convenience methods, language patches, and useful extensions. It also includes a couple command-line widgets. Its primary inspirations were an awesome gem called Wirble and a blog post by Amy Hoy called \"Secrets Of The Rails Console Ninjas\".\n\n(http://slash7.com/articles/2006/12/21/secrets-of-the-rails-console-ninjas)\n\n== INSTALL\n\nsudo gem install utility_belt\n\n== FEATURES\n\n* Interactively edit IRB code in your preferred text editor\n* Read from and write to OS X clipboard\n* Post your code to Pastie with one command (OS X only)\n* Kick-ass Unix-style history buffer\n* Write command history to file or vi\n* Grep classes and methods for strings\n* Verbosity controls for regular IRB and Rails console\n* Finder shortcuts for Rails console\n* Upload shortcut for Amazon S3\n* Command-line Amazon S3 upload script\n* Command-line Google shortcut (OS X only)\n* Auto-indentation\n* _ special variable (like Unix shell var !!)\n* Extremely basic themes for Wirble syntax coloring\n* Pascal/JavaScript-style \"with\" statement\n* String#to_proc\n* Add and subtract Hashes with + and -\n* Grammatically-correct is_an? method - no more \"is_a?

See copyright notice for the credits. A lot of this code comes from blogs. Check out the source code for numerous links to the original posts the code came from. Thanks also to Bob Hutchison, Avdi Grimm, Marcus Derencius, Markus Prinz, Ben Bleything, Reginald Braithwaite-Lee, and Robert Berger for bug fixes, new features, documentation, and bug reports.\n\n== SYNOPSIS\n\nUtility Belt gives you a ton of new options and techniques in IRB. (You may find yourself putting its language patches in actual projects as well.) The way to use Utility Belt is to edit, or create, your .irbrc file. This is analogous to a Unix .bashrc, .tcshrc, .profile, or similar file.\n\nWindows users have a couple options. The easiest is to define an environment variable called IRBRC and set it to the full path of your irbrc (e.g. \"C:\\Documents and Settings\\<username>\\_irbrc\"). Presto, .irbrc for Windows. You could also set your HOME-Variable to any directory you want and put your \".irbrc\" in there. (It needs to be called \".irbrc\", \"_irbrc\" won't work). Since Windows Explorer won't let you create a file with a dot in the beginning, use any text editor (Notepad will do just fine) and \"Save As\" to save it as \".irbrc\". (The quotation marks make the magic happen.) We don't recommend this if you're also using MSYS or Cygwin, as they use the same variable for their own purposes.\n\nAdding Utility Belt to your .irbrc is easy:\n\n  require 'rubygems'\n  require 'utility_belt'\n\nTo use the Amazon shortcuts, you also need to set some environment variables. See the section on S3 under \"Usage\" for more. Also, if your terminal has a light background, you'll need to enable the light-background syntax coloring theme - see the section on themes under \"Usage\" for more.\n\n== USAGE\n\nUsing each of Utility Belt's tools is different:\n\n== Interactively edit IRB code in your preferred text editor\n\nIf your preferred text editor is vi(m), emacs, or TextMate, there are built-in commands: vi, emacs, and mate, respectively. To use another editor, use this command:\n\n  edit_interactively(:the_name_of_my_editor)\n\nor\n\n  edit_interactively(\"the name of my editor\")\n\nor\n\n  edit_interactively(\"/the/path/to/my/editor\")\n\nIf you're wondering why the method name is so ridiculously long, there's a story there:\n\nhttp://gilesbowkett.blogspot.com/2007/12/utility-belt-vs-rails.html\n\n== Read from and write to OS X clipboard\n\nTo read:\n\n  MacClipboard.read\n\nTo write:\n\n  MacClipboard.write(\"something\")\n\n== Post your code to Pastie with one command (OS X only)\n\nFirst copy some code into your clipboard, or put it there with the MacClipboard.write() class method. Then use the command:\n\n  pastie\n\nor the shortcut version:\n\n  pst\n\nNote that this method currently auto-formats all code as Ruby. Support for other languages is possible but not implemented yet. Also, this code is OS X only because it uses the MacClipboard. (A platform-agnostic version without the clipboard aspect is certainly possible.)\n\n== Unix-style history buffer\n\nUse \"h\" or \"history\" to view your command history, and \"h! 123\" to re-invoke command #123 in your buffer. \"h!\" with no args will run the last command.\n\n== Write command history to file or vi\n\nTo write your history to a file, use \"history_write('/path/to/file')\". To edit your history in vi, use \"history_to_vi\" or its shortcut alias \"hvi\".\n\n== Grep classes and methods for strings\n\nClasses:\n\n  >> grep_classes(\"ixnum\")\n  #=> [\"Fixnum\"]\n\n  >> grep_classes(\"num\")\n  #=> [\"Bignum\", \"Fixnum\", \"Numeric\", \"REXML::SyncEnumerator\"]\n\nMethods:\n\n  >> \"any arbitrary string\".grep_methods(\"pretty\")\n  #=> [\"pretty_inspect\", \"pretty_print_instance_variables\", \"pretty_print_inspect\", \"pretty_print\", \"pretty_print_cycle\"]\n\n  >> 32.grep_methods(\"*\")\n  #=> [\"*\", \"**\"]\n\nAt some point it'll probably be a good idea to add regex support for these methods.\n\n== Verbosity controls for regular IRB and Rails console\n\nregular IRB: \"verbose\" or \"v\" / \"quiet\" or \"q\"\n\nRails: \"log\" method turns verbosity on, there isn't actually any method for turning it off. (Might add one at some point.)\n\n== Finder shortcuts for Rails console\n\n  user(:all) / user(1)\n\ninstead of\n\n  User.find(:all) / User.find(1)\n\nSupports arbitrarily complex finds.\n\n== Upload shortcut for Amazon S3\n\nFirst, define your secret keys in your environment variables:\n\nexport AMAZON_ACCESS_KEY_ID='foofoofoofoofoo'\nexport AMAZON_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY='barbarbarbarbar'\n\n(Obviously, replace those with actual values.)\n\nThen, you can use\n\n  aws_upload(\"bucket_name\",\"filename\")\n\nTo easily upload public-access files. This method will automatically connect to Amazon S3 for you, if your keys are defined in your environment variables. It also writes the resulting Amazon URL to your clipboard, if you're on OS X, so you can easily share the file with others. Note that you have to create the initial buckets manually - see amazon.rubyforge.org for details on that.\n\nA good way to use this is actually to have a default bucket, and create a further method in your .irbrc file:\n\n  def my_bucket_name(filename)\n    aws_upload(\"my_default_bucket\",filename)\n  end\n\n== Command-line Amazon S3 upload script\n\nUtility Belt also includes amazon, a simple command-line uploader for S3. It requires that you set your Amazon environment variables (see above). The usage is:\n\n  amazon -b my_bucket_name filename other_filename\n\n(For any arbitrary number of filenames.)\n\nAnytime you want to upload a file to your default bucket on S3, for example, the \"images\" bucket for your blog - or the \"mp3\" bucket if you're running a blog like Projectionist - all you have to do is\n\n  amazon -b blog_files some_file.name\n\nOr\n\n  amazon --bucket blog_files some_file.name\n\nAnd you're good to go. Of course, if that were too many characters to type, you could always take it one step further with a shell script. For instance, in bash:\n\n  alias b1=\"amazon --bucket my_main_bucket $1\"\n  alias b2=\"amazon --bucket my_other_bucket $1\"\n\nAnd then you would only have to type:\n\n  b1 file.name\n\nAnd of course tab completion will handle all the typing of the file name, assuming you choose your file names deliberately ahead of time to make tab completion effective, in which case all you have to type is \"b1 f[tab]\" and bam.\n\n== Command-line Google shortcut (OS X only)\n\nTo pop open a new window in your default browser with Google search results for a given search term, do:\n\n  google \"any given term\"\n\nFor one-word terms, you can omit the quotes:\n\n  google term\n\nIf you already have the search term in your clipboard, you can just type:\n\n  google\n\n(The last approach is useful for unusual command-line error messages.)\n\n== Auto-indentation and tab completion\n\nJust type as normally. This just enables built-in but underused functionality in IRB. (The IRB default auto-indentation isn't perfect, but it clobbers the living hell out of no indentation at all.)\n\n== _ special variable (like Unix shell var !!)\n\nMore activation of built-in but underused functionality in IRB. _ functions like !! in Unix, with one subtle difference. Instead of re-issuing the previous command in your history, it gives you the last result of evaluating a command. This means when you start a new IRB session, _ won't go to your history, it'll just give you nil, and it means that some commands can't be repeated exactly. Nine out of ten times, however, it's pretty much the same thing.\n\nNote that when combined with the h! in the command history code, you basically have two synonyms for !! here. Neither one is an exact replica, but between the two of them, you should have what you need.\n\n== Extremely basic themes for Wirble syntax coloring\n\nUtility Belt incorporates Wirble as a dependency. Wirble provides syntax coloring. Utility Belt allows you to choose between two syntax coloring themes: Wirble's default, and an alternate color set for terminals with light backgrounds. The default theme is enabled by default (duh), but if you have a terminal with a light background, you can enable the light-background theme just by putting the following line of code in your .irbrc:\n\n  UtilityBelt::Themes.background(:light)\n\nTo revert back to the default, just use this:\n\n  UtilityBelt::Themes.background(:dark)\n\nTo specify an entirely new syntax color scheme, see the source code for this gem or for Wirble.\n\n== Pascal/JavaScript-style \"with\" statement\n\nI use this with RSpec's spec_helper. Instead of:\n\n  Spec::Runner.configure do |config|\n    config.use_transactional_fixtures = true\n    config.use_instantiated_fixtures  = false\n    config.fixture_path = RAILS_ROOT + '/spec/fixtures'\n    config.mock_with :flexmock\n  end\n\nI do this:\n\n  Spec::Runner.configure do |config|\n    with(config) do\n      use_transactional_fixtures = true\n      use_instantiated_fixtures  = false\n      fixture_path = RAILS_ROOT + '/spec/fixtures'\n      mock_with :flexmock\n    end\n  end\n\nNote however that this blew up once and I have no idea why. Caveat emptor, et cetera.\n\n== String#to_proc\n\nSyntactic sugar for functional programming.\n\n  (1..3).map(&'*2') => [2, 4, 6]\n  (1..3).map(&'[-1, _, 0]') => [[-1, 1, 0], [-1, 2, 0], [-1, 3, 0]]\n  (1..3).map(&'x -> y -> x * y').map(&'[2]') => [2, 4, 6]\n  (1..5).select(&'>2') => [3, 4, 5]\n  (1..3).map(&'x -> y -> x * y').map(&'.call(2)') => [2, 4, 6]\n  [5].map(&\"(1.._).inject(&'*')\") => [120]\n\nFor more detail see: http://weblog.raganwald.com/2007/10/stringtoproc.html\n\n== Add and subtract Hashes with + and -\n\n  {:a => :b} + {:c => :d} = {:a => :b, :c => :d}\n  {:a => :b, :c => :d} - {:c => :d} = {:a => :b}\n  {:a => :b, :c => :d} - :c = {:a => :b}\n\n  You could already do this with Arrays; now you can do it with Hashes as well. (I was kinda surprised the first time I tried to do this and realized I'd have to write it myself.)\n\n== Grammatically-correct is_an? method - no more \"is_a? Array\" statements\n\n  >> [].is_an? Array\n  #=> true\n\nMost people don't care, but personally, \"is_a? Array\" drives me completely insane.\n\n== Object#not\n\nReplace this:\n\n  if !response.incomplete? && !response.invalid? && response.total > 0\n\nWith this:\n\n  if response.not.incomplete? && response.not.invalid? && response.total > 0\n\nSyntactic sugar for boolean conditions.\n\nMore detail here:\n\nhttp://blog.jayfields.com/2007/08/ruby-adding-not-method-for-readability.html\n\n== One-character exit command\n\nx\n\nBecause life is too short to type whole words.\n\n== REQUIREMENTS\n\n* ReadLine\n* Wirble\n* Amazon S3\n* Platform\n* Some features require OS X\n\n== LICENSE\n\n  (The MIT License)\n\n  Copyright (c) 2006-2007 Giles Bowkett\n  Portions Copyright (c) 2006-2007 Ben Bleything\n  Portions Copyright (c) 2006-2007 Reginald Braithwaite\n  Portions Copyright (c) 2006-2007 Gregory Brown\n  Portions Copyright (c) 2006-2007 Jamis Buck\n  Portions Copyright (c) 2006-2007 Mike Clark\n  Portions Copyright (c) 2006-2007 Jay Fields\n  Portions Copyright (c) 2005 David Heinemeier Hansson\n  Portions Copyright (c) 2006-2007 Ara T.

    "Readme": "attachment-fu\n=============\n\nattachment_fu is a plugin by Rick Olson (aka technoweenie <http://techno-weenie.net>) and is the successor to acts_as_attachment.  To get a basic run-through of its capabilities, check out Mike Clark's tutorial <http://clarkware.com/cgi/blosxom/2007/02/24#FileUploadFu>.\n\n\nattachment_fu functionality\n===========================\n\nattachment_fu facilitates file uploads in Ruby on Rails.  There are a few storage options for the actual file data, but the plugin always at a minimum stores metadata for each file in the database.\n\nThere are three storage options for files uploaded through attachment_fu:\n  File system\n  Database file\n  Amazon S3\n\nEach method of storage many options associated with it that will be covered in the following section.  Something to note, however, is that the Amazon S3 storage requires you to modify config/amazon_s3.yml and the Database file storage requires an extra table.\n\n\nattachment_fu models\n====================\n\nFor all three of these storage options a table of metadata is required.  This table will contain information about the file (hence the 'meta') and its location.  This table has no restrictions on naming, unlike the extra table required for database storage, which must have a table name of db_files (and by convention a model of DbFile).\n\nIn the model there are two methods made available by this plugins: has_attachment and validates_as_attachment.\n\nhas_attachment(options = {})\n  This method accepts the options in a hash:\n    :content_type     # Allowed content types.\n                      # Allows all by default.  Use :image to allow all standard image types.\n    :min_size         # Minimum size allowed.\n                      # 1 byte is the default.\n    :max_size         # Maximum size allowed.\n                      # 1.megabyte is the default.\n    :size             # Range of sizes allowed.\n                      # (1..1.megabyte) is the default.  This overrides the :min_size and :max_size options.\n    :resize_to        # Used by RMagick to resize images.\n                      # Pass either an array of width/height, or a geometry string.\n    :thumbnails       # Specifies a set of thumbnails to generate.\n                      # This accepts a hash of filename suffixes and RMagick resizing options.\n                      # This option need only be included if you want thumbnailing.\n    :thumbnail_class  # Set which model class to use for thumbnails.\n                      # This current attachment class is used by default.\n    :path_prefix      # path to store the uploaded files.\n                      # Uses public/#{table_name} by default for the filesystem, and just #{table_name} for the S3 backend.  \n                      # Setting this sets the :storage to :file_system.\n    :storage          # Specifies the storage system to use..\n                      # Defaults to :db_file.  Options are :file_system, :db_file, and :s3.\n    :processor        # Sets the image processor to use for resizing of the attached image.\n                      # Options include ImageScience, Rmagick, and MiniMagick.  Default is whatever is installed.\n\n\n  Examples:\n    has_attachment :max_size => 1.kilobyte\n    has_attachment :size => 1.megabyte..2.megabytes\n    has_attachment :content_type => 'application/pdf'\n    has_attachment :content_type => ['application/pdf', 'application/msword', 'text/plain']\n    has_attachment :content_type => :image, :resize_to => [50,50]\n    has_attachment :content_type => ['application/pdf', :image], :resize_to => 'x50'\n    has_attachment :thumbnails => { :thumb => [50, 50], :geometry => 'x50' }\n    has_attachment :storage => :file_system, :path_prefix => 'public/files'\n    has_attachment :storage => :file_system, :path_prefix => 'public/files', \n                   :content_type => :image, :resize_to => [50,50]\n    has_attachment :storage => :file_system, :path_prefix => 'public/files',\n                   :thumbnails => { :thumb => [50, 50], :geometry => 'x50' }\n    has_attachment :storage => :s3\n\nvalidates_as_attachment\n  This method prevents files outside of the valid range (:min_size to :max_size, or the :size range) from being saved.  It does not however, halt the upload of such files.  They will be uploaded into memory regardless of size before validation.\n\n  Example:\n    validates_as_attachment\n\n\nattachment_fu migrations\n========================\n\nFields for attachment_fu metadata tables...\n  in general:\n    size,         :integer  # file size in bytes\n    content_type, :string   # mime type, ex: application/mp3\n    filename,     :string   # sanitized filename\n  that reference images:\n    height,       :integer  # in pixels\n    width,        :integer  # in pixels\n  that reference images that will be thumbnailed:\n    parent_id,    :integer  # id of parent image (on the same table, a self-referencing foreign-key).\n                            # Only populated if the current object is a thumbnail.\n    thumbnail,    :string   # the 'type' of thumbnail this attachment record describes.  \n                            # Only populated if the current object is a thumbnail.\n                            # Usage:\n                            # [ In Model 'Avatar' ]\n                            #   has_attachment :content_type => :image, \n                            #                  :storage => :file_system, \n                            #                  :max_size => 500.kilobytes,\n                            #                  :resize_to => '320x200>',\n                            #                  :thumbnails => { :small => '10x10>',\n                            #                                   :thumb => '100x100>' }\n                            # [ Elsewhere ]\n                            # @user.avatar.thumbnails.first.thumbnail #=> 'small'\n  that reference files stored in the database (:db_file):\n    db_file_id,   :integer  # id of the file in the database (foreign key)\n\nField for attachment_fu db_files table:\n  data, :binary # binary file data, for use in database file storage\n\n\nattachment_fu views\n===================\n\nThere are two main views tasks that will be directly affected by attachment_fu: upload forms and displaying uploaded images.\n\nThere are two parts of the upload form that differ from typical usage.\n  1. Include ':multipart => true' in the html options of the form_for tag.\n    Example:\n      <% form_for(:attachment_metadata, :url => { :action => \"create\" }, :html => { :multipart => true }) do |form| %>\n\n  2. Use the file_field helper with :uploaded_data as the field name.\n    Example:\n      <%= form.file_field :uploaded_data %>\n\nDisplaying uploaded images is made easy by the public_filename method of the ActiveRecord attachment objects using file system and s3 storage.\n\npublic_filename(thumbnail = nil)\n  Returns the public path to the file.  If a thumbnail prefix is specified it will return the public file path to the corresponding thumbnail.\n  Examples:\n    attachment_obj.public_filename          #=> /attachments/2/file.jpg\n    attachment_obj.public_filename(:thumb)  #=> /attachments/2/file_thumb.jpg\n    attachment_obj.public_filename(:small)  #=> /attachments/2/file_small.jpg\n\nWhen serving files from database storage, doing more than simply downloading the file is beyond the scope of this document.\n\n\nattachment_fu controllers\n=========================\n\nThere are two considerations to take into account when using attachment_fu in controllers.\n\nThe first is when the files have no publicly accessible path and need to be downloaded through an action.\n\nExample:\n  def readme\n    send_file '/path/to/readme.txt', :type => 'plain/text', :disposition => 'inline'\n  end\n\nSee the possible values for send_file for reference.\n\n\nThe second is when saving the file when submitted from a form.\nExample in view:\n <%= form.file_field :attachable, :uploaded_data %>\n\nExample in controller:\n  def create\n    @attachable_file = AttachmentMetadataModel.new(params[:attachable])\n    if @attachable_file.save\n      flash[:notice] = 'Attachment was successfully created.'\n      redirect_to attachable_url(@attachable_file)     \n    else\n      render :action => :new\n    end\n  end\n\n",

It uses a simple DSL (borrowed in part from Rake, http://rake.rubyforge.org/) that allows you to define _tasks_, which may be applied to machines in certain roles. It also supports tunneling connections via some gateway machine to allow operations to be performed behind VPN's and firewalls.\n\nCapistrano was originally designed to simplify and automate deployment of web applications to distributed environments, and originally came bundled with a set of tasks designed for deploying Rails applications. The deployment tasks are now (as of Capistrano 2.0) opt-in and require clients to explicitly put\n\"load 'deploy'\" in their recipes.\n\n== Dependencies\n\n* Net::SSH and Net::SFTP (http://net-ssh.rubyforge.org)\n* Needle (via Net::SSH)\n* HighLine (http://highline.rubyforge.org)\n\nIf you want to run the tests, you'll also need to have the following dependencies installed:\n\n* Mocha (http://mocha.rubyforge.org)\n\n== Assumptions\n\nCapistrano is \"opinionated software\", which means it has very firm ideas about how things ought to be done, and tries to force those ideas on you. Some of the assumptions behind these opinions are:\n\n* You are using SSH to access the remote servers.\n* You either have the same password to all target machines, or you have public keys in place to allow passwordless access to them.\n\nDo not expect these assumptions to change.\n\n== Usage\n\nIn general, you'll use Capistrano as follows:\n\n* Create a recipe file (\"capfile\" or \"Capfile\").\n* Use the +cap+ script to execute your recipe.\n\nUse the +cap+ script as follows:\n\n    cap sometask\n\nBy default, the script will look for a file called one of +capfile+ or +Capfile+. The +someaction+ text indicates which task to execute. You can do \"cap -h\" to see all the available options and \"cap -T\" to see all the available tasks.\n\n== KNOWN ISSUES\n\n* Using \"put\" to upload a file to two or more hosts when a gateway is in effect has a good chance of crashing with a \"corrupt mac detected\" error. This is due to a bug in Net::SSH.\n* Running commands may rarely hang inexplicably. This appears to be specific only to certain platforms. Most people will never see this behavior.\n",

    "Name": "masochism",
    "Readme": "masochism\n\n\nphoto by ArtWerk\n\nThe masochism plugin provides an easy solution for Ruby on Rails applications to work in a\nreplicated database environment. It works by replacing the connection object accessed by\nActiveRecord models by ConnectionProxy that chooses between master and slave when\nexecuting queries. Generally all writes go to master.\nQuick setup\nFirst, setup your database.yml:\n# default configuration (slave)\nproduction: &defaults\n  adapter: mysql\n  database: app_production\n  username: webapp\n  password: ********\n  host: localhost\n\n# setup for masochism (master)\nmaster_database:\n  <<: *defaults\n  host: master.example.com\n\nTo enable masochism, this is required:\n# enable masochism\nActiveReload::ConnectionProxy.setup!\n\nExample usage:\n# in environment.rb\nconfig.after_initialize do\n  if Rails.env.production?\n    ActiveReload::ConnectionProxy::setup!\n  end\nend\n\nConsiderations\nThinking Sphinx\nThinking Sphinx inspects the connection object to determine the database adapter.\nBecause masochism works by putting the connection proxy in its place, TS will be confused\nabout ActiveReload::ConnectionProxy and abort. A possible workaround is to monkeypatch TS right to hardcode our adapter after masochism has been enabled:\n# ConnectionProxy from masochism confuses TS\nThinkingSphinx::Index.class_eval do\n  def adapter() :mysql end\nend\n\nThinkingSphinx::AbstractAdapter.class_eval do\n  def self.detect(model)\n    ThinkingSphinx::MysqlAdapter\n  end\nend\n\nLitespeed web server or Phusion Passenger (mod_rails)\nIf you are using the Litespeed web server or Passenger (mod_rails), child processes are initialized on creation,\nwhich means any setup done in an environment file will be effectively ignored. A brief\ndiscussion of the problem is posted here.\nOne solution for Litespeed/Passenger users is to check the connection at your first request and do\nthe setup! call if your connection hasn't been initialized, like:\n# in ApplicationController\nprepend_before_filter do |controller|\n  unless ActiveRecord::Base.connection.is_a? ActiveReload::ConnectionProxy\n    ActiveReload::ConnectionProxy.setup!\n  end\nend\n\nAdvanced\nThe ActiveReload::MasterDatabase model uses a 'master_database' setting that can either be\ndefined for all of your environments, or for each environment as a nested declaration.\nThe ActiveReload::SlaveDatabase model uses a 'slave_database' setting that can only be\ndefined per environment.\nExample:\nlogin: &login\n  adapter: postgresql\n  host: localhost\n  port: 5432\n\nproduction:\n  database: production_slave_database_name\n  <<: *login\n\nmaster_database:\n  database: production_master_database_name\n  <<: *login\n\nstaging:\n  database: staging_database_name\n  host: slave-db-pool.local\n  <<: *login\n  master_database: \n    database: staging_database_name\n    host: master-db-server.local\n    <<: *login\n\nqa:\n  database: qa_master_database_name\n  host: qa-master\n  <<: *login\n  slave_database:\n    database: qa_slave_database_name\n    host: qa-slave\n    <<: *login\n\ndevelopment: # Does not use masochism\n  database: development_database_name\n  <<: *login\n\nIf you want a model to always use the Master database, you can inherit\nActiveReload::MasterDatabase. Any models with their own database connection will not be\naffected.\nMore control at setup\nBy default, masochism setup! is a shorthand for this:\nActiveReload::ConnectionProxy.setup_for ActiveReload::MasterDatabase, ActiveRecord::Base\n\nThe first argument is the model that has the master database connection established; the\nsecond argument is the model whose connection gets hijacked by ConnectionProxy. But we\ndon't have to touch ActiveRecord::Base at all:\n# set up MyMaster's connection as the master database connection for User:\nActiveReload::ConnectionProxy.setup_for MyMaster, User\n\nThe controller filter\nIf you have any actions you know require the master database for both reads and writes,\nsimply do the following:\n# in a controller:\naround_filter ActiveReload::MasterFilter, :only => [:show, :edit, :update]\n\n",

When true everything that has a not-null value will be considered deleted.\nFiltering\nIf a record is deleted by ActsAsParanoid, it won't be retrieved when accessing the database.\nSo, Paranoiac.all will not include the deleted records.\nWhen you want to access them, you have 2 choices:\nParanoiac.only_deleted # retrieves only the deleted records\nParanoiac.with_deleted # retrieves all records, deleted or not\nWhen using the default column_type of 'time', the following extra scopes are provided:\ntime = Time.now\n\nParanoiac.deleted_after_time(time)\nParanoiac.deleted_before_time(time)\n\n# Or roll it all up and get a nice window:\nParanoiac.deleted_inside_time_window(time, 2.minutes)\nReal deletion\nIn order to really delete a record, just use:\nparanoiac.destroy!\nParanoiac.delete_all!(conditions)\nYou can also permanently delete a record by calling destroy_fully! on the object.\nAlternatively you can permanently delete a record by calling destroy or delete_all on the object twice.\nIf a record was already deleted (hidden by ActsAsParanoid) and you delete it again, it will be removed from the database.\nTake this example:\np = Paranoiac.first\np.destroy # does NOT delete the first record, just hides it\nParanoiac.only_deleted.where(:id => p.id).destroy # deletes the first record from the database\nRecovery\nRecovery is easy. Just invoke recover on it, like this:\nParanoiac.only_deleted.where(\"name = ?\", \"not dead yet\").first.recover\nAll associations marked as :dependent => :destroy are also recursively recovered.\nIf you would like to disable this behavior, you can call recover with the recursive option:\nParanoiac.only_deleted.where(\"name = ?\", \"not dead yet\").first.recover(:recursive => false)\nIf you would like to change this default behavior for one model, you can use the recover_dependent_associations option\nclass Paranoiac < ActiveRecord::Base\n    acts_as_paranoid :recover_dependent_associations => false\nend\nBy default, dependent records will be recovered if they were deleted within 2 minutes of the object upon which they depend.\nThis restores the objects to the state before the recursive deletion without restoring other objects that were deleted earlier.\nThe behavior is only available when both parent and dependant are using timestamp fields to mark deletion, which is the default behavior.\nThis window can be changed with the dependent_recovery_window option:\nclass Paranoiac < ActiveRecord::Base\n    acts_as_paranoid\n    has_many :paranoids, :dependent => :destroy\nend\n\nclass Paranoid < ActiveRecord::Base\n    belongs_to :paranoic\n\n    # Paranoid objects will be recovered alongside Paranoic objects\n    # if they were deleted within 10 minutes of the Paranoic object\n    acts_as_paranoid :dependent_recovery_window => 10.minutes\nend\nor in the recover statement\nParanoiac.only_deleted.where(\"name = ?\", \"not dead yet\").first.recover(:recovery_window => 30.seconds)\nValidation\nActiveRecord's built-in uniqueness validation does not account for records deleted by ActsAsParanoid. If you want to check for uniqueness among non-deleted records only, use the macro validates_as_paranoid in your model. Then, instead of using validates_uniqueness_of, use validates_uniqueness_of_without_deleted. This will keep deleted records from counting against the uniqueness check.\nclass Paranoiac < ActiveRecord::Base\n  acts_as_paranoid\n  validates_as_paranoid\n  validates_uniqueness_of_without_deleted :name\nend\n\np1 = Paranoiac.create(:name => 'foo')\np1.destroy\n\np2 = Paranoiac.new(:name => 'foo')\np2.valid? #=> true\np2.save\n\np1.recover #=> fails validation!\nStatus\nYou can check the status of your paranoid objects with the deleted? helper\nParanoiac.create(:name => 'foo').destroy\nParanoiac.with_deleted.first.deleted? #=> true\nScopes\nAs you've probably guessed, with_deleted and only_deleted are scopes. You can, however, chain them freely with other scopes you might have.\nFor example:\nParanoiac.pretty.with_deleted\nThis is exactly the same as:\nParanoiac.with_deleted.pretty\nYou can work freely with scopes and it will just work:\nclass Paranoiac < ActiveRecord::Base\n  acts_as_paranoid\n  scope :pretty, where(:pretty => true)\nend\n\nParanoiac.create(:pretty => true)\n\nParanoiac.pretty.count #=> 1\nParanoiac.only_deleted.count #=> 0\nParanoiac.pretty.only_deleted.count #=> 0\n\nParanoiac.first.destroy\n\nParanoiac.pretty.count #=> 0\nParanoiac.only_deleted.count #=> 1\nParanoiac.pretty.only_deleted.count #=> 1\nAssociations\nAssociations are also supported.\nFrom the simplest behaviors you'd expect to more nifty things like the ones mentioned previously or the usage of the :with_deleted option with belongs_to\nclass Parent < ActiveRecord::Base\n  has_many :children, :class_name => \"ParanoiacChild\"\nend\n\nclass ParanoiacChild < ActiveRecord::Base\n  acts_as_paranoid\n  belongs_to :parent\n\n  # You may need to provide a foreign_key like this\n  belongs_to :parent_including_deleted, :class_name => \"Parent\", :foreign_key => 'parent_id', :with_deleted => true\nend\n\nparent = Parent.first\nchild = parent.children.create\nparent.destroy\n\nchild.parent #=> nil\nchild.parent_including_deleted #=> Parent (it works!)\nCaveats\nWatch out for these caveats:\n\n  You cannot use scopes named with_deleted and only_deleted\n  You cannot use scopes named deleted_inside_time_window, deleted_before_time, deleted_after_time if your paranoid column's type is time\n  You cannot name association *_with_deleted\n unscoped will return all records, deleted or not\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nTo Rick Olson for creating acts_as_paranoid\nTo cheerfulstoic for adding recursive recovery\nTo Jonathan Vaught for adding paranoid validations\nTo Geoffrey Hichborn for improving the overral code quality and adding support for after_commit\nTo flah00 for adding support for STI-based associations (with :dependent)\nTo vikramdhillon for the idea and initial implementation of support for string column type\nTo Craig Walker for Rails 3.1 support and fixing various pending issues\nTo Charles G. for Rails 3.2 support and for making a desperately needed global code refactoring\nTo Gon\u00e7alo Silva for supporting this gem prior to v0.4.3\nTo Jean Boussier for initial Rails 4.0.0 support\nTo Matijs van Zuijlen for Rails 4.1 and 4.2 support\nTo Andrey Ponomarenko for Rails 5 support\n\nSee LICENSE.\n",

    "Readme": "WARNING: ABANDONED SOFTWARE, YMMV\n=================================\n\nSputnik was a fun project but it has not been maintained since 2012 and\nnone of the primary contributors have plans to maintain it in the future.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n============\n\nSputnik is a wiki/cms written in Lua. It is intended to be primarily used\nas a web application, but could also be accessed programmatically.\nSee http://spu.tnik.org/ for more information.  \n\nSputnik is free / open source software, distributed under the MIT License.\nSome optional plugins are distributed under other free software licenses.\nSee attached LICENSE.txt for more information.\n\n(c) 2007-2012 Yuri Takhteyev (most of the code)\nSome of the code is (c) other authors. (See LICENSE.txt for details.)\n\nContact: <qaramazov@gmail.com>\n\n\nINSTALLATION\n============\n\nIf you are simply looking to install Sputnik using the easiest method, you\nprobably shouldn't be reading this. The simplest way to install Sputnik is by\nusing one of our installers that relies on LuaRocks. If you want to try this\noption, go to http://spu.tnik.org/en/Installation and follow the instructions\ngiven there.\n\nSimilarly, if you do want to install the latest version from our source\ncode repository, see http://spu.tnik.org/en/Source.\n\nIf you really want to install Sputnik by hand using the source code in this\ndirectory, see \"Manual Installation and Use\" below. Meanwhile, let's look at\nwhat we've got in this directory.\n\n\nSOURCE CODE ORGANIZATION\n========================\n\nThis directory contains a number of sub-directories, representing \"rocks\"\n- collections of Lua modules that can be installed as a unit using LuaRocks.\nEach rock directory has a subdirectory called \"lua\" which has the actual Lua\ncode, organized into modules. One rock may define multiple modules. So, we\nhave for example\n\n    sputnik/lua/sputnik/init.lua\n       |     |     |       |      \n       |     |     |     submodule\n       |     |   module   \n       | lua code\n     rock     \n\nThe minimal set of rocks that you will need to run Sputnik is:\n\n    sputnik - the core of Sputnik\n    saci - Saci, a versioned document management system behind Sputnik\n\nThere are also some rocks representing optional plugins:\n\n    sputnik-medialike - a plugin offering support for mediawiki markup\n    sputnik-tickets - a bug tracking plugin\n    sputnik-mbox - a plugin enabling archival of mailing list\n\nSome of those optional plugins may be out of date. A few other ones are\navailable in the \"out-of-date-but-potentially-useful\" directory:\n\n    sputnik-pod - a plugin offering support for POD markup\n    sputnik-search-google - a plugin for google search\n    versium-svn - stores your data in subversion (needs updating)\n    sputnik-examples - a basic set of demos\n    sputnik-luausers - a demo showing Lua-Users wiki data loading into Sputnik\n    sputnik-tests - some old tests\n\nThose are quite certainly out of date.\n\nMANUAL INSTALLATION AND USE\n===========================\n\nIf you really want to install Sputnik by hand using the source code in this\ndirectory, you will need the following dependencies:\n\n1. Lua5.1\n2. Binary Lua libraries: luasocket, lbase64, MD5, lpeg, luafilesystem* \n3. Pure-lua Lua libraries: cosmo, coxpcall, wsapi, diff, markdown*\n\nNote: luafilesystem and markdown are not strictly speaking required, but are\nassumed by the _default_ storage system and markup module.\n\nYou may also want to install the \"optional but highly recommended\" modules:\n\n    xssfilter - a filter against cross-site scripting\n    recaptcha - a Lua API for recaptcha (http://recaptcha.net)\n\nFor a basic Sputnik installation, you will need to copy the following\ndirectories to where your Lua can find it.\n\n    sputnik/lua/*\n    saci/lua/*\n\nYou should then use the script sputnik/bin/sputnik.lua to generate a WSAPI-\ncompatible launcher script:\n\n    sputnik.lua make-cgi\n\nproduces \"sputnik.ws\", which is a Lua script that defines a WSAPI application.\n\nYou can run Sputnik on any server for which there is a WSAPI bridge. The\neasiest, however, is Xavante, a pure-lua web server. To do this, install\nXavante libraries where Lua can find them and run Sputnik as follows:\n\n    sputnik.lua start-xavante sputnik.ws\n\nFor other options see the wiki and WSAPI documentation.\n\n\n",

Those responses can then\nbe exported for consumption in some other application (CRM, etc).\n\nInstall the extension, run the rake radiant:extensions:database_form:migrate\ntask, and the rake radiant:extensions:database_form:update task. These\ntasks will add the necessary database table to your Radiant installation\nand copy over the JavaScript that's required for client-side validation.\n\nOnce you've done this, log into the Radiant admin and set the page type\nof the page where you'll build the form to DatabaseFormPage. Then create\nyour form using tags.

Thanks to Andrew Tetlaw\nfor his spiffy Prototype-based validation JavaScript. If you wish to include\nvalidation in your form, you must set the validate attribute in the form tag.\nYou can then choose from a variety of validation routines for the form\nelements, including: required, validate-number, validate-digits, \nvalidate-alpha, validate-alphanum, validate-date, validate-email,\nvalidate-url, validate-currency-dollar, validate-selection, and\nvalidate-one-required. You'll also need to include prototype in your layout,\nof course (IMPORTANT; without it validation won't work).\n\n<r:database:form name=\"contact\" validate=\"true\">\n  <r:database:text name=\"name\" validate=\"required\"/>\n  <r:database:text name=\"email\" validate=\"required validate-email\"/>\n</r:database:form>\n\nIf you care to, you can style these validations using CSS:\n\ninput.validation-failed, textarea.validation-failed {\n        border: 1px solid #900;\n        color: #900;\n}\n.validation-advice {\n        margin: 5px 0;\n        padding: 5px;\n        background-color: #900;\n        color: #FFF;\n        font-weight: bold;\n}\n\nThe Database Forms extension also adds a tab to Radiant's admin\ninterface which can be used to export user form data. You can select\nby form name (the name you assigned to a form in its tag) and date\nranges. XML is the only supported export format at this time.\n\nMaybe we'll sexy this up some day and make listings browsable through\nthe admin but the most common use case is probably exporting data, and\nthat's what we needed at the time, so it is what it is. If you'd like\nto extend it, we definitely welcome submissions.\n\nThis extension is based on the Mailer extension by Matt McCray and \n(originally) Sean Cribbs. It was inspired by a post on SuperGloo's blog\nhttp://code.supergloo.com/2007/12/12/radiant-cms-database-form-extension\nbut should be a bit more flexible than what was described there,\nallowing you to add arbitrary forms at will without adding database \ntables (model attributes for the FormResponse model are serialized\nand stored in a content text area).\n\nDeveloped by Nick Plante for Ubikorp Internet Services. \nTested on Radiant 0.6.4.\n\nhttp://github.com/zapnap/database_form\n\nhttp://blog.zerosum.org\nhttp://www.ubikorp.com\n\n",

    "Readme": "Rack Interface Filter is a simple filter that can be deployed to a servlet container. On startup, the filter \ninstantiates a JRuby instance, bootstraps a ruby web framework, then instantiates a rack adaptor for that framework.\nWhen an request comes in, the filter translates the request to a RubyHash and passes it to the rack adaptor's call method.\n\nThis is very much a work in progress, and the only framework with which it has been used is Merb. There is currently no\nsupport for bundling up a ruby web application as a war file, though it shouldn't be hard to add.\n\nTo test this with a merb application, add a WEB-INF directory to the public directory:\n\n/MerbApp\n  /app\n  /config\n  /public\n    /WEB-INF\n      /classes\n      /lib\n        bsf.jar\n        commons-logging-1.x.jar\n        jruby.jar        \n        RackInterface-0.x.jar\n      web.xml\n  Rakefile\n  /spec\n\n\nSample web.xml:\n\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\n<!DOCTYPE web-app PUBLIC \"-//Sun Microsystems, Inc.//DTD Web Application 2.3//EN\" \"http://java.sun.com/dtd/web-app_2_3.dtd\">\n<web-app>\n    <display-name>Rack Test</display-name>\n\n    <distributable/>\n\n    <filter>\n        <filter-name>RackInterface</filter-name>\n        <filter-class>com.zumisoft.rack.RackFilter</filter-class>\n      <init-param>\n        <param-name>framework</param-name>\n        <param-value>merb</param-value>\n      </init-param>\n    </filter>\n\n    <filter-mapping>\n        <filter-name>RackInterface</filter-name>\n        <url-pattern>/*</url-pattern>\n    </filter-mapping>\n\n    <session-config>\n      <session-timeout>30</session-timeout> \n    </session-config>\n</web-app>\n\n\nTo test this with tomcat, create the file\n\n$CATALINA_HOME/conf/Catalina/localhost/ROOT.xml:\n\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\n<Context docBase=\"/path/to/merb/app/public\" path=\"\" />\n\n\nFrom here, you should have the merb app deployed to the root of the server (though it should be possible to map it to \nsome other url).\n\nStart up tomcat, and try to hit the app.\n\nThe placement of WEB-INF, the general assumptions about directory layouts, and war packaging are all fluctuating at the moment. This layout seemed like the quickest way to get a test with Merb running.\n\nThere are a few issues already. For one, sometimes the rack adaptor is returning a <File> object as the third element\nin the response tuple. I'm not sure what to do about that yet. If strings are returned, everything works. As a workaround\nfor that, you can specify ignore paths (\"/images\", \"/stylesheets\", \"/javascript\", \"/favicon.ico\" by default). If a reuest\nis made for a url that starts with an ignore path, it's passed to the servlet container's default servlet. Right now, this is just passing through requests for static content. My guess is that the default servlet is better at handling static content anyway,\nbut this behavior might have to change. You could also use the ignore path to allow requests to flow through to other servlets or\nfilters to stack ruby web apps or regular java servlets.\n\nAs a disclaimer, I clearly have no idea what I'm doing. Any help or suggestions would be great.\n\n",

Expire and update automatically.\nINSTALL:\n\nas gem: sudo gem install cached_values\nas plugin: ./script/plugin install git://github.com/JackDanger/cached_values.git\n\nUSAGE:\nYou can calculate values with a single line in any ActiveRecord model.  To actually save those values you'll need to create\nan attribute in your schema.  By default the cached_value instance will look for an attribute with the same name as itself.\nYou can override this by specifying a :cache => :some_attribute option\nA very simple case in which cached_values works just like the .count method on a has_many association:\nclass Leprechaun < ActiveRecord::Base\n  caches_value :total_gold_coins, :sql => 'select count(*) from gold_coins where leprechaun_id = #{id}'\nend\n\nCompany.find(4).total_employees # => 45\n\nA more sophisticated example:\nclass Leprechaun < ActiveRecord::Base\n  has_many :lucky_charms\n  has_many :deceived_children, :through => :lucky_charms\n  caches_value :total_children_remaining_to_be_deceived, :sql => '... very complicated sql here ...'\nend\n\nLeprechaun.find(14).total_children_remaining_to_be_deceived # => 6,692,243,122\n\nThe values can be of any type.  The plugin will attempt to cast SQL results to the type corresponding with their database cache\nbut calculations in Ruby are left alone.\nYou can also calculate the value in Ruby using a string to be eval'ed or a Proc.  Both are evaluated\nin the context of the record instance.\nclass Leprechaun < ActiveRecord::Base\n  caches_value :total_gold, :eval => \"some_archaic_and_silly_calculation(gold_coins)\"\n  caches_value :total_lucky_charms, :eval => Proc.new {|record| record.calculate_total_lucky_charms }\nend\n\nThe cache is customizable, you can specify which attribute should be used as a cache:\ncaches_value :runic_formula, :sql => '...'          # uses 'runic_formula' column if it exists\ncaches_value :standard_deviation_of_gold_over_time, # uses 'std' column if it exists\n             :sql => '...', :cache => 'std'\ncaches_value :id, :sql => '...', :cache => false    # does NOT persist to db, just memoize in memory.  This avoids overwriting the attribute of the same name.\n\nActiveRecord callbacks can be used to reload (update cache and reload instance) at certain times:\ncaches_value :standard_deviation, :sql => '...', :reload => [:before_save, :after_destroy]\ncaches_value :runic_formula, :sql => '...', :reload => :after_create\n\nPatches welcome, forks celebrated.\nCopyright (c) 2007 Jack Danger Canty @ http://j\u00e5ck.com, released under the MIT license\n",

You have recent posts on your blog's index page.  You have\n  an Atom feed.  You have recent posts on your blog's Atom feed.  See where I'm\n  going with this?\n\n  The hAtom microformat (or uformat) can be embedded in your existing HTML by\n  setting CSS classes with semantic meaning inside of your posts.  A class to signify\n  a post is contained within this div, a class to signify the contents of this\n  h3 are the post's title, a class to signify the contents of this span is the\n  blog post's author, etc.\n\n  You can then use a microformat parser (like, say, mofo) to extract this information\n  as you would from an Atom feed.  Hell, you can even convert hAtom to Atom.  It's an\n  insta-feed!  No extra code required!\n\n  You're already doing the work, you see.  Microformats are everywhere.  We just need\n  to set them free.\n\n  Check it:\n\n    <div class=\"post\">\n      <h3>Megadeth Show Last Night</h3>\n      <span class=\"subtitle\">Posted by Chris on June 4th</span>\n      <div class=\"content\">Went to a show last night.  Megadeth.  It was alright.</div>\n    </div>\n\n  Right?  Normal.  Here's the same post marked up with hAtom:\n\n    <div class=\"post hentry\">\n      <h3 class=\"entry-title\">Megadeth Show Last Night</h3>\n      <span class=\"subtitle\">Posted by <span class=\"author vcard fn\">Chris</span> on \n      <abbr class=\"updated\" title=\"2006-06-04T10:32:10Z\">June 4th</abbr></span>\n      <div class=\"content entry-content\">Went to a show last night.  Megadeth.  It was alright.</div>\n    </div>\n\n  All I did was add the hentry, entry-title, and entry-content classes to existing containers.  Then I\n  went ahead and wrapped the date in an <abbr> tag giving it a title in the microformat-standard way.  Finally\n  I put a div around Chris signifying it as the author field of the hEntry and making it a valid hCard by\n  including the vcard and fn classes.  It's really not all that hard.  Did I mess it up?  Maybe, but I'm sure I got\n  close.  And I didn't even use a reference.  Practice.\n\n  How'd we parse this, tho?\n\n    $ irb -rubygems\n    >> require 'mofo'\n    => true\n\n    >> post = HEntry.find 'http://milesofstyle.org/posts/351-megadeth-show-last-night.html'\n    => #<HEntry:0x6db898 ... > \n\n    >> post.entry_title\n    => \"Megadeth Show Last Night\"\n\n    >> post.properties\n    => [\"entry_content\", \"updated\", \"author\", \"entry_title\"]\n\n    >> post.updated\n    => Sun Jun 04 10:32:10 UTC 2006\n\n    >> post.updated.class\n    => Time\n\n    >> post.author\n    => #<HCard:0x6e7b98 @properties=[\"fn\"], @fn=\"Chris\">\n\n    >> post.author.fn\n    => \"Chris\"\n\n    >> post.entry_content\n    => \"Went to a show last night.

    "Readme": "\nRubiGen - Ruby Generator Framework\n\ndrnic.github.com/rubigen\n\nDESCRIPTION:\nA framework to allow Ruby applications to generate file/folder stubs  (like\nthe `rails` command does for Ruby on Rails, and the\n'script/generate' command within a Rails application during\ndevelopment).\nBackground\nRubiGen is originally extracted from Ruby on Rails (specifically the\nrails_generator from its railties gem).\nThe rails_generator was hardcoded with Rails-specific dependencies\n(`RAILS_ROOT`),  Rails generators ('app' = Rails application;\n'model' = Rails model+tests+migration), and generally assumed it\nwas the only generator framework within the Ruby world (it was). So, any\nRubyGem whose name ended with '_generator' was assumed to be a\ngenerator for a Rails application.\nBut if you are developing an Adhearsion application, then you may want a\ndifferent set of generators. If you are developing a RubyGem, then you will\nwant a different set of generators.\nRubiGen exists to give different development environments their own\ngenerator framework.\nThanks go to\u2026\nJeremy Kemper wrote the original Rails Generator, which is 95% of the basis\nof RubiGen. He's awesome.\nInstallation\nRubiGen is only required at development time, and normally isn't\nrequired at deployment time (unless your application uses it to generate\nfiles at runtime).\nOn your development machine:\nsudo gem install rubigen\nUsage\nRubiGen comes with a stand-alone executable to allow you to invoke\ngenerators:\nFor example, to run the rails' `model` generator:\nrubigen rails model Person name:string\nwould replace the normal\nscript/generate model Person name:string\nRubiGen has been traditionally integrated into another project, such as\n`rails`, `newgem` or `camping`, rather than be used on its own.\nThese frameworks might use RubiGen for two reasons:\n\nTo generate an initial stub for developers, e.g. `rails` generated a stub\nto write a Rails application. `newgem` generates a stub to write a RubyGem.\nBTW - RubiGen has a builtin application `ruby_app` which generates a\nbare-bones Ruby application stub (lib, test, and script folders, plus a\nRakefile, and a script/generate script)\n\nTo generate components within their development areas, e.g. Rails had its\n`script/generate` script within each Rails application, which hooked back\ninto the rails_generator to lookup and execute generators.\n\nSo, there are two steps to integrating RubiGen into your framework:\n\nUse it to generate an initial stub for the developers of your framework.\nThis would create the folders  (`lib/app`, `test`, `script`, `doc`, `log`,\netc) and starting files (`Rakefile`,  `README.txt`, `test/test_helper.rb`\netc). Importantly, it would generate a `script/generate` file. The\n`script/generate` file (example below) will allow developers of your\nframework to  generate components/extensions within the framework. RubiGen\nallows you to restrict which generators are available. For example, within\nRubyGem development environment (as generated by `newgem`), the\n`script/generator` only shows `rubygem`-related generators. Rails could\nrestrict `script/generator` to only show Rails related generators\n\nYour framework RubyGem (e.g. `newgem` or `rails`) needs to add `rubigen` as\na  dependency, so that users of your RubyGem can access the generator\nframework.\n\nCreating generators\nThere are two types of generators:\n\nApplication Generators - used by developers of your framework to get\nstarted.  Generally, you will create one Application Generator for your\nframework. It generates a base stub (such as the `rails` stub for new Rails\napplications) for your framework users.\n\nComponent Generators - used by developers to extend their application. You\nmay include 1+ built-in generators with your framework. Developers can also\nwrite generators for your framework, and like Rails' generator install\nthem in various places and have access to their via RubiGen.\n\nCreating an Application Generator for your Framework\nWithout RubiGen, to give your users a head start and create a stub for\nthem, you will  copiously use `mkdir_p` and `File.open`. Your script will\neither be primitive (only create the bare folders and very few files) or it\nwill be very long and unreadable (ok, perhaps I'm just talking about\nthe `newgem` script, which I am dubiously responsible for\u2026 :P).\nWith RubiGen, you can create stubs using powerful, yet simple, syntax.\nTemplates are extracted into a `templates` folder, and activating the\ngenerator from a script requires only a few lines of code.\nThese are the `newgem` files related to its Application Generator.\nbin/\n  bin/newgem        # Application Generator script; Usage: newgem gemname [options]\napp_generators/\n  app_generators/newgem/\n    app_generators/newgem/newgem_generator.rb\n    app_generators/newgem/USAGE\n    app_generators/newgem/templates/\n      app_generators/newgem/templates/app.rb\n      app_generators/newgem/templates/History.txt\n      app_generators/newgem/templates/... lots and lots of templates\nThe `bin/newgem` script is very simple, and looks like:\nrequire 'rubygems'\nrequire 'rubigen'\n\nif %w(-v --version).include?

This\ngem, composite_primary_keys, or CPK for short, extends ActiveRecord to\nsupport composite keys.\nInstallation\ngem install composite_primary_keys\nIf you are using Rails add the following to your Gemfile:\ngem 'composite_primary_keys', '=x.x.x' (see next section about what verison to use)\nVersions\nEvery major version of ActiveRecord has included numerous internal changes.\nAs a result, CPK has to be rewritten for each version of ActiveRecord.  To\nhelp keep things straight, here is the mapping:\nVersion 9.x is designed to work with ActiveRecord 5.0.x\nVersion 8.x is designed to work with ActiveRecord 4.2.x\nVersion 7.x is designed to work with ActiveRecord 4.1.x\nVersion 6.x is designed to work with ActiveRecord 4.0.x\nVersion 5.x is designed to work with ActiveRecord 3.2.x\nVersion 4.x is designed to work with ActiveRecord 3.1.x\nRun the following command to list available versions:\ngem list composite_primary_keys -ra\nThe basics\nA model with composite primary keys is defined like this:\nclass Membership < ActiveRecord::Base\n  self.primary_keys = :user_id, :group_id\n  belongs_to :user\n  belongs_to :group\n  has_many :statuses, :class_name => 'MembershipStatus', :foreign_key => [:user_id, :group_id]\nend\nNote the addition of the line:\nself.primary_keys = :user_id, :group_id\nA model associated with a composite key model is defined like this:\nclass MembershipStatus < ActiveRecord::Base\n  belongs_to :membership, :foreign_key => [:user_id, :group_id]\nend\nThat is, associations can include composite keys too.  All Rails\nassociation types are supported. Nice.\nUsage\nOnce you\u2019ve created your models to specify composite primary keys (such as\nthe Membership class) and associations (such as\nMembershipStatus#membership), you can uses them like any normal model with\nassociations.\nBut first, lets check out our primary keys.\nMembershipStatus.primary_key # => \"id\"    # normal single key\nMembership.primary_key  # => [:user_id, :group_id] # composite keys\nMembership.primary_key.to_s # => \"user_id,group_id\"\nNow we want to be able to find instances using the same syntax we always\nuse for ActiveRecords\u2026\nMembershipStatus.find(1)    # single id returns single instance\n=> <MembershipStatus:0x392a8c8 @attributes={\"id\"=>\"1\", \"status\"=>\"Active\"}>\nMembership.find([1,1])  # composite ids returns single instance\n=> <Membership:0x39218b0 @attributes={\"user_id\"=>\"1\", \"group_id\"=>\"1\"}>\nNotice the use of an array to specify the composite key values.\nNOTE - API CHANGE.  CPK Version 6.x and earlier used to allow composite\nkeys to be listed out like this:\nMembership.find(1,1)\nThis usage is no longer supported.\nDatabases\nCPK supports the following databases:\n* PostgreSQL\n* MySQL\n* MariaDB\n* Oracle\n* DB2\n* SQLite\n* SQLServer\nTests\nTravis build status: \nSee test/README_tests.rdoc for more information about running tests.\nQuestions, Discussion and Contributions\nFor help please visit github.com/composite-primary-keys/composite_primary_keys.\nAuthor\nFirst version was written by Dr Nic Williams.\nMaintained by Charlie Savage\nContributions by many!\n",

    "Readme": "= RubyCAS-Client\n\nAuthor::    Matt Zukowski <matt AT roughest DOT net>; inspired by code by Ola Bini <ola.bini AT ki DOT se> and Matt Walker <mwalker AT tamu DOT edu>\nCopyright:: (c) 2008 Urbacon Ltd.\nLicense::   GNU Lesser General Public License v2.1 (LGPL 2.1)\nWebsite::   http://code.google.com/p/rubycas-client and http://rubyforge.org/projects/rubycas-client\n\n\n=== RubyCAS-Client is a Ruby client library for Yale's Central Authentication Service (CAS) protocol.\n\nCAS provides a secure single sign on solution for web-based applications. The user logs in to your\norganization's CAS server, and is automatically authenticated for all other CAS-enabled applications.\n\nFor general information about the open CAS protocol, please have a look at http://www.ja-sig.org/products/cas.\n\nIf your organization does not already have a CAS server, you may be interested in RubyCAS-Client's sister project,\nRubyCAS-Server[http://code.google.com/p/rubycas-server/].\n\n\n== Getting help and reporting problems\n\nIf you need help, try posting to the RubyCAS discussion group at http://groups.google.com/group/rubycas-server.\n\nTo report problems, please use the Google Code issue tracker at http://code.google.com/p/rubycas-client/issues/list.\n\n\n== Installation\n\nYou can download the latest version of RubyCAS-Client from the project's rubyforge page at \nhttp://rubyforge.org/projects/rubycas-client.\n\nHowever, it is easier to install the CAS client into a Ruby on Rails app as a plugin:\n\n  cd <your rails app>\n  ./script/plugin install http://rubycas-client.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/rubycas-client\n\nAlternatively, the library is also installable as a RubyGem[http://rubygems.org]:\n\n  gem install rubycas-client\n\nIf your Rails application is under Subversion control, you can also install the plugin as an svn:external, ensuring that\nyou always have the latest bleeding-edge version of RubyCAS-Client:\n\n  ./script/plugin install -x http://rubycas-client.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/rubycas-client\n\n\n== Usage Examples\n\nAlthough RubyCAS-Client can be used with other web Frameworks (for example Camping), the following examples\nare aimed at {Ruby on Rails}[http://rubyonrails.org].\n\n==== Using RubyCAS-Client in Rails controllers\n\n<i>Note that from this point on we are assuming that you have a working CAS server up and running!</i>\n\nAfter installing RubyCAS-Client as a plugin (see above), add the following to your app's <tt>config/environment.rb</tt>:\n\n  CASClient::Frameworks::Rails::Filter.configure(\n    :cas_base_url => \"https://cas.example.foo/\"\n  )\n\n(Change the <tt>:cas_base_url</tt> value to your CAS server's base URL; also note that many CAS servers are configured\nwith a base URL that looks more like \"https://cas.example.foo/cas\".)\n\nThen, in your <tt>app/controllers/application.rb</tt> (or in whichever controller you want to add the CAS filter for):\n\n  before_filter CASClient::Frameworks::Rails::Filter\n\nThat's it. You should now find that you are redirected to your CAS login page whenever you try to access any action\nin your protected controller. You can of course qualify the <tt>before_filter</tt> as you would with any other ActionController\nfilter. For example: \n\n  before_filter CASClient::Frameworks::Rails::Filter, :except => [ :unprotected_action, :another_unprotected_action ]\n\n<b>Once the user has been authenticated, their authenticated username is available under <tt>session[:cas_user]</tt>,</b>\nIf you want to do something with this username (for example load a user record from the database), you can append another \nfilter method that checks for this value and does whatever you need it to do.\n\n\n==== A more complicated example\n\nHere is a more complicated configuration showing most of the configuration options along with their default values\n(this does not show proxy options, which are covered in the next section):\n\n  # enable detailed CAS logging\n  cas_logger = CASClient::Logger.new(RAILS_ROOT+'/log/cas.log')\n  cas_logger.level = Logger::DEBUG\n\n  CASClient::Frameworks::Rails::Filter.configure(\n    :cas_base_url  => \"https://cas.example.foo/\",\n    :login_url     => \"https://cas.example.foo/login\",\n    :logout_url    => \"https://cas.example.foo/logout\",\n    :validate_url  => \"https://cas.example.foo/proxyValidate\",\n    :session_username_key => :cas_user,\n    :session_extra_attributes_key => :cas_extra_attributes\n    :logger => cas_logger,\n    :authenticate_on_every_request => true\n  )\n\nNote that it is normally not necessary to specify <tt>:login_url</tt>, <tt>:logout_url</tt>, and <tt>:validate_url</tt>.\nThese values are automatically set to standard CAS defaults based on the given <tt>:cas_base_url</tt>.\n\nThe <tt>:session_username_key</tt> value determines the key under which you can find the CAS username in the Rails session hash.\n\nAny additional info that the CAS server might have supplied about the user during authentication will be found under the\n<tt>:session_extra_attributes_key</tt> value in the Rails session hash (i.e. given the above configuration, you would find this\ninfo under <tt>session[:cas_extra_attributes]</tt>).\n\nAn arbitrary Logger instance can be given as the :logger parameter. In the example above we log all CAS activity to a \n<tt>log/cas.log</tt> file in your Rails app's directory.\n\n==== Re-authenticating on every request (i.e. the \"single sign-out problem\")\n\nBy default, the Rails filter will only authenticate with the CAS server when no session[:cas_user] value exists. Once the user \nhas been authenticated, no further CAS forwarding is done until the user's session is wiped. This saves you\nthe trouble of having to do this check yourself (since in most cases it is not advisable to go through the CAS server\non every request -- this is slow and would potentially lead to problems, for example for AJAX requests). However,\nthe disadvantage is that the filter no longer checks to make sure that the user's CAS session is still actually open.\nIn other words it is possible for the user's authentication session to be closed on the CAS server without the\nclient application knowing about it.\n\nIn the future RubyCAS-Client will support the new \"Single Sign-Out\" functionality in CAS 3.1, allowing the server to \nnotify the client application that the CAS session is closed, but for now it is up to you  to handle this by, for example, \nby wiping the local session[:cas_user] value periodically to force a CAS re-check.\n\nAlternatively, it is possible to disable this authentication persistence behaviour by setting the <tt>:authenticate_on_every_request</tt>\nconfiguration option to true as in the example above.\n\n\n==== Defining a 'logout' action\n\nYour Rails application's controller(s) will probably have some sort of logout function. In it you will likely reset the \nuser's session for your application, and then redirect to the CAS server's logout URL. Here's an example of how to do this:\n\nclass ApplicationController < ActionController::Base\n\n  # ...\n\n  def logout\n    reset_session\n    redirect_to CAS::Filter.logout_url(self, request.referer)\n  end\nend\n\n\n==== Gatewayed (i.e. optional) authentication\n\n\"Gatewaying\" essentially allows for optional CAS authentication. Users who already have a pre-existing CAS SSO session \nwill be automatically authenticated for the gatewayed service, while those who do not will be allowed to access the service \nwithout authentication. This is useful for example when you want to show some additional private content on a homepage to \nauthenticated users, but also want anonymous users to be able to access the page without first logging in.\n\nTo allow users to access a page without authenticatin, simply use <tt>CASClient::Frameworks::Rails::GatewayFilter</tt>\nin place of <tt>CASClient::Frameworks::Rails::Filter</tt> in your controller. For example, you may want to require\nCAS authentication for all actions in a controller except the index action:\n\n  class ExampleController < ApplicationController\n    before_filter CASClient::Frameworks::Rails::GatewayFilter, :only => :index\n    before_filter CASClient::Frameworks::Rails::Filter, :except => :index\n\n    # ...\n  end\n\n\n==== How to act as a CAS proxy\n\nCAS 2.0 has a built-in mechanism that allows a CAS-authenticated application to pass on its authentication to other applications.\nAn example where this is useful might be a portal site, where the user logs in to a central website and then gets forwarded to\nvarious other sites that run independently of the portal system (but are always accessed via the portal). The exact mechanism\nbehind this is rather complicated so I won't go over it here. If you wish to learn more about CAS proxying, a great walkthrough\nis available at http://www.ja-sig.org/wiki/display/CAS/Proxy+CAS+Walkthrough.\n\nRubyCAS-Client fully supports proxying, so a CAS-protected Rails application can act as a CAS proxy.\n\nAdditionally, RubyCAS-Client comes with a controller that can act as a CAS proxy callback receiver. This is necessary because\nwhen your application requests to act as a CAS proxy, the CAS server must contact your application to deposit the proxy-granting-ticket\n(PGT). Note that in this case the CAS server CONTACTS YOU, rather than you contacting the CAS server (as in all other CAS operations).\n\nConfused? Don't worry, you don't really have to understand this to use it. To enable your Rails app to act as a CAS proxy, \nall you need to do is this:\n\nIn your <tt>config/environment.rb</tt>:\n\n  # enable detailed CAS logging for easier troubleshooting\n  cas_logger = CASClient::Logger.new(RAILS_ROOT+'/log/cas.log')\n  cas_logger.level = Logger::DEBUG\n\n  CASClient::Frameworks::Rails::Filter.configure(\n    :cas_base_url => \"https://cas.example.foo/\",\n    :proxy_retrieval_url => \"https://cas-proxy-callback.example.foo/cas_proxy_callback/retrieve_pgt\",\n    :proxy_callback_url => \"https://cas-proxy-callback.example.foo/cas_proxy_callback/receive_pgt\",\n    :logger => cas_logger\n  )\n\nIn <tt>config/routes.rb</tt> make sure that you have a route that will allow requests to /cas_proxy_callback/:action to be routed to the\nCasProxyCallbackController. This should work as-is with the standard Rails routes setup, but if you have disabled the default\nroute, you should add the following:\n\n  map.cas_proxy_callback 'cas_proxy_callback/:action', :controller => 'cas_proxy_callback'\n\nNow here's a big giant caveat: <b>your CAS callback application and your CAS proxy application must run on separate Rails servers</b>.\nIn other words, if you want a Rails app to act as a CAS ticket-granting proxy, the cas_proxy_callback controller\nmust run on a different server. This is because Rails does not properly support handling of concurrent requests. The CAS proxy mechanism\nacts in such a way that if your proxy application and your callback controller were on the same server\nyou would end up with a deadlock (the CAS server would be waiting for its callback to be accepted by your Rails server,\nbut your Rails server wouldn't respond to the CAS server's callback until the CAS server responded back first).\n\nThe simplest workaround is this:\n\n1. Create an empty rails app (i.e. something like <tt>rails cas_proxy_callback</tt>)\n2. Make sure that you have the CAS plugin installed. If you installed it as a gem, you don't have to do anything since\n   it is already installed. If you want to install as a plugin, see the instructions in the \"Installing\" section above.\n3. Make sure that the server is up and running, and configure your proxy_callback_url and proxy_retrieval_url to point\n   to the new server as described above (or rather, make Pound point to the new server, if that's how you're handling https).\n\nThat's it. The proxy_callback_controller doesn't require any additional configuration. It doesn't access the database\nor anything of that sort.\n\nOnce your user logs in to CAS via your application, you can do the following to obtain a service ticket that can then be used\nto authenticate another application:\n\n  service_uri = \"http://some-other-application.example.foo\"\n  proxy_granting_ticket = session[:cas_pgt]\n  ticket = CASClient::Frameworks::Rails::Filter.client.request_proxy_ticket(service_uri, proxy_granting_ticket).ticket\n\n<tt>ticket</tt> should now contain a valid service ticket. You can use it to authenticate other services by sending it and \nthe service URI as parameters to your target application:\n\n  http://some-other-application.example.foo?service=#{CGI.encode(ticket.target_service)}&ticket=#{ticket.proxy_ticket}\n\nThis is of course assuming that http://some-other-application.example.foo is also protected by the CAS filter. \nNote that you should always URI-encode your service parameter inside URIs!\n\nNote that #request_proxy_ticket returns a CASClient::ProxyTicket object, which is why we need to call #ticket on it \nto retrieve the actual service ticket string.\n\n===== Additional proxying notes and caveats\n\n<b>The proxy url must be an https address.</b> Otherwise CAS will refuse to communicate with it. This means that if you are using\nthe bundled cas_proxy_callback controller, you will have to host your application on an https-enabled server. This can be a bit\ntricky with Rails. WEBrick's SSL support is difficult to configure, and Mongrel doesn't support SSL at all. One workaround is to\nuse a reverse proxy like Pound[http://www.apsis.ch/pound/], which will accept https connections and locally re-route them\nto your Rails application. Also, note that <i>self-signed SSL certificates likely won't work</i>. You will probably need to use\na real certificate purchased from a trusted CA authority (there are ways around this, but good luck :)\n\n\n== SSL Support\n\nMake sure you have the Ruby OpenSSL library installed. Otherwise you may get errors like:\n\n  no such file to load -- net/https\n\nTo install the library on an Debian/Ubuntu system:\n\n  sudo apt-get install libopenssl-ruby\n\nFor other platforms you'll have to figure it out yourself.\n\n\n\n== License\n\nThis program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify\nit under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public License as published by\nthe Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or\n(at your option) any later version.\n\nThis program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\nbut WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\nMERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

    "Readme": "\n\ufeff=Globalite\nGlobalite is meant to be a breed of the best\ninternationalization/localization plugins available for Rails.\nGlobalite should provide you with a 3-in-1 solution:\n\nEasy UI localization.\n\nRails localization. (Localization of the core functions from rails)\n\nSimple yet powerful solution for user content availability in multiple\nlanguages.\n\nOn top of that: yml files are used for most of the localization, which\nmakes Globalite a light and fast solution. The Locale is set on the\nuser's session making Globalite a perfect solution for multilingual\nsupport. The developer can pass dynamic values to be used in the\nlocalization.\nWhat's the difference between Globalite and the other existing l10n/i18n plugins?\nGibberish is a nice plugin but it doesn't handle locales, you can't\nhave your application in British English and American English. I also\ndon't really like the syntax :p I based the UI localization of\nGlobalite on Chris' work on Gibberish.\nGlobalize is a great plugin but man, it's bloated\u2026 I would like to have\nsomething a bit lighter and easier to use. (less options, less setup time,\nless database usage). I decided to trim down Globalize to offer less\noptions and fulfill the needs of most developers.\nAlso, Globalite doesn't have the concept of a base language. Mainly\nbecause I think that's a bad idea. If you use English as your base\nlanguage and you need to fix a string in English(you did a typo), you will\nbreak all the other translations. That's why Globalite uses\nlocalization keys only.\nUsage\ninstallation:\nscript/plugin install git://github.com/mattetti/globalite.git     (or as a\ngem from github)\nUI Localization:\nCreate a lang folder at the root of your project. Add your localization\nfiles in the lang/ui folder if you want to localize your interface.\nDeclare the current locale or language in your environment.rb > \n    Globalite.language = :fr     Localize a key in your view > \n    :localization_key.l  or     :localization_key.localize\nEasy, isn't?\nAdvanced users can also do more:\nYou can also pass an optional localization string only used if the\nlocalization is missing     :missing_localization_key.l(\u201ctext used if the key\nis not localized yet\u201d)\nYou can also pass values to the localization, and the translator can do\nwhatever he wants with them:        :welcome_user.l_with_args({:user =>\n@user.name}) would render \u201cWelcome Matt!\u201d Note that variables can be used\nin any order the translator wants\nYou can also use pluralization right in your translations:\ngeese_amount:  we have pluralize{{geese_count}, goose, geese} in the farm!\nIn your view do the following:\n:geese_amount.l_with_args({:geese_count => @geese.count})\nNote that the pluralization form of your string is optional, you could use\na translation like that too:\ncow_amount:  we have pluralize{{count}, cow} in the farm!\nBy pushing the pluralization to the translator, I  believe we offer more\nflexibility so the translation can be smoother. This solution was inspired\nby a discussion with Ivan: \u201cIt's very difficult to just translate\n\u201dprohibited this\u201c and \u201dfrom being saved\u201c to Chinese, cause the resulting\nsentence will look like a machine translated one without making much sense.\nNot to mention Chinese handles pluralization differently, we pretty much\ndon't have it. For example, we'll use the same word for \u201dperson\u201c\nand \u201dpeople\u201c, no difference. So to me, it makes sense just to replace the\nwhole thing with one simple header message that says \u201dInvalid attributes!\u201c\nin Chinese.\u201d\nRails Localization:\nLocalize a time object by using a predefined format (defined in the\ndate_helper_time_formats variable that you can find  in globalite/lang/rails/.yml)\nGlobalite.language = :fr     Time.now.l(:long)\nLocalize a date object by using a predefined format (defined in the\ndate_helper_date_formats variable that you can find  in globalite/lang/rails/.yml)        Date.today.l\nIn your views, create a select box with a list of all countries(listed in\nthe locale language):   country_options_for_select\nIn your views, create a select box with a list of all the months(listed in\nthe locale language) with the current month selected:\n    select_month(Time.now)   In your views, create a set of html select-tags\n(one for year, month, day, hour, and minute):   select_datetime      In your\nviews, create a set of html select-tags (one for year, month, and day):\n    select_date      Get a number returned in currency, for instance if the\nlocale was set to 'fr' the returned value would be 123,00 \u20ac but if\nthe locale was set to 'en-US' it would return $123.00\n    number_to_currency(123)\nGet a distance of time in words localized.\n    distance_of_time_in_words(10.minutes.ago, Time.now)\nGet the %edit% and %new% verbs in the url tanslated  grandascenseurs.fr/ascenseurs/nouvelle\nhaberler.com.tr/haberler/17/duzenle\nActive record errors are automatically rendered in the locale language\nLocalize field names in validator messages\nBy default, here is the normal validation behavior:\nName cannot be empty (en) Name nie mo\u017ce by\u0107 puste(y,a) (pl)\nHowever, Name should be replaced with 'Nazwa' in polish.\nConsider the following example:\nvalidates_presence_of :name, :email, :age\nGlobaLite will try to use your yml language files entries using the\nfollowing localization keys: name:, email:, age:. Globalite will also try\nto replace model name from validation messages with localized version from\nyml file, i.e. the message below:\n8 errors prohibited this user from being saved\n^^^^\nwill be localized and 'user' will be replaced if 'user' key\nexists in yml language file.\nIf the plugin can't find any localizations, the original field name\nwill be used. You can get rid of field name in custom validation message\nwith :message attribute.\nvalidates_uniqueness_of :name, :message => '^my message'\nNotes\nCheck on the tests in the spec folder for more examples. There's also a\ndemo app available: github.com/mattetti/globalite-example\nFAQ:\nWhy did you call your plugin 'Globalite'? \nGlobalize was already taken ;) More seriously, I was looking for a\ni18n/l10n solution for a project I was working on, after few hours testing\nGlobalize, Josh joshknowles.com, Matt\nheidmotron.com/ and I railsontherun.com saw it wouldn't\nwork for us. Since we only had the choice between very simple solutions and\na complicated solution, I decided to make a \u201clite\u201d version of Globalize ;)\nTODO:\n\nModel i18n/l10n\n\nInternationalization, Localization, Locale:\nInternationalization refers to the process of modifying an application\u2019s\ndesign so that it can support  locale differences like text orientation,\ncurrency, date and time format, sorting, and so forth. This can be done  by\nexternalizing text strings into files or a database, and by developing\ncurrency and date formatting utilities.\nLocalization means adapting an application to a specific language or\nlocale; for example, by translating  text into multiple languages. A locale\nis identified by the user\u2019s language and country, and specifies how, for \nexample, numbers, currencies, and dates are displayed on the screen. The\ncode for the US English locale is  en-US. Locales are specified by RFC 3066\nand consist of two parts. The first is an ISO 639 language code and  uses\nlowercase letters. The second is usually an ISO 3166 country code in\nuppercase letters.\nfrom Ruby on Rails Commerce (Hellsten, Laine)\n\nCREDITS:\nSome code was very influenced from different projects such as:\n\nGibberish require.errtheblog.com/plugins/browser/gibberish\nwritten by Chris Wanstrath (errtheblog.com)\n\nGlobalize www.globalize-rails.org written\nby too many people to list them here ;)\n\nLocalizationSimplified (L10n-simplified) written By Jesper Ronn-Jensen ( justaddwater.dk/ )\n\nAuthor:\nMatt Aimonetti  railsontherun.com \nmattaimonetti AT gmail DOT com\nContributors:\nMert Torun (resource path localization) Ivan Chang yuanhueichang AT\ngmail_DOT_com ( Chinese translation, help on the ActiveRecord msg error\ni18n/l10n) Ralph von Der Heyden ralph AT rvdh_DOT_de (German translation)\njiman.ryu AT gmail jasonpa.tistory.com/ (bug fix)\nGuillaume Belleguic guillaume.belleguic AT oceans DOT eu (Model error\nhandling) Marcus Derencius derencius AT gmail_dot_com (Brazilian Portuguese\ntranslation) MrPrise (Hungarian localization) Koen Punt (Dutch\nlocalization) Mariano Ayesa (Spanish Spain and Argentina localization)\njyrkij github.com/jyrkij (Finnish)\nIlke Akdeniz (Turkish) Dejan Dimic (Serbian) Tosoa Bacca (Malagasy)\nyour name here if you submit a patch :)\nMore info:\ngithub.com/mattetti/globalite\nrailsontherun.com/globalite\nSample app: github.com/mattetti/globalite-example\n\n",

MIT licensed.\nDemos\npersonal\nhttp://projects.gregweber.info/demo/flavorzoom.html\noutside\nhttp://silverwareconsulting.com/index.cfm/2008/10/2/jquery-autofiltering-table\nthis is a nice example that ties this plugin with the tablesorter plugin\nusage\n          var t = $('table')\n          $.uiTableFilter( t, phrase )\n\narguments:\n* jQuery object containing table rows\n* phrase to search for\n  - If the phrase contains spaces it will be broken up into separate words that must all match a row\n\noptional arguments:\n              $.uiTableFilter( t, phrase, column, ifHidden )\n* column to limit search too (the column title in the table header)\n* ifHidden - callback to execute if one or more elements was hidden\n\nWarning:\n\nexpects a thead and tbody element\n\n",

    "Readme": "= xss_terminate\n\n+xss_terminate+ is a plugin in that makes stripping and sanitizing HTML \nstupid-simple. Install and forget. And forget about forgetting to <tt>h()</tt>\nyour output, because you won't need to anymore.\n\nBut +xss_terminate+ is also flexible. By default, it will strip all HTML tags\nfrom user input. This is usually what you want, but sometimes you need users to be \nable to enter HTML. The plugin allows you remove bad HTML with your choice\nof two whitelist-based sanitizers, or to skip HTML sanitization entirely on\na per-field basis.\n\nTo install, do:\n\n  script/plugin install http://xssterminate.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/xss_terminate\n\n== HTML sanitization\n\nA note on your choices.\n\n* Strip tags: removes all HTML using Rails's built-in +strip_tags+ method. Tags are removed, but their content is not.\n* Rails sanitization: Removes bad HTML with Rails's built-in sanitize method. Bad tags are removed completely, including their content.\n* HTML5lib sanitization: Removes bad HTML after parsing it with {HTML5lib}[http://code.google.com/p/html5lib/], a library that parses HTML like browsers do. It should be very tolerant of invalid HTML. Bad tags are escaped, not removed.\n* Do nothing. You can chose not to process given fields.\n\n== Usage\n\nInstalling the plugin creates a +before_save+ hook that will strip HTML tags \nfrom all string and text fields. No further configuration is necessary if this\nis what you want. To customize the behavior, you use the +xss_terminate+ class \nmethod.\n\nTo exempt some fields from sanitization, use the <tt>:except</tt> option \nwith a list of fields not to process:\n\n class Comment < ActiveRecord::Base\n   xss_terminate :except => [ :body ]\n end\n\nTo sanitize HTML with Rails's built-in sanitization, use the <tt>:sanitize</tt> option:\n\n  class Review < ActiveRecord::Base\n    xss_sanitize :sanitize => [ :body, :author_name]\n  end\n\nTo sanitize HTML with {HTML5Lib}[http://code.google.com/p/html5lib/] \n(<tt>gem install html5</tt> to get it), use the <tt>:html5lib_sanitize</tt> \noption with a list of fields to sanitize:\n\n class Entry < ActiveRecord::Base\n   xss_terminate :html5lib_sanitize => [ :body, :author_name ]\n end\n\nYou can combine multiple options if you have some fields you would like skipped\nand others sanitized. Fields not listed in the option arrays will be stripped.\n\n class Message < ActiveRecord::Base\n   xss_terminate :except => [ :body ], :sanitize => [ :title ]\n end\n\n== Sanitizing existing records\n\nAfter installing +xss_terminate+ and configuring it to your liking, you can \nrun <tt>rake xss_terminate MODELS=Foo,Bar,Baz</tt> to execute it against your\nexisting records. This will load each model found and save it again to invoke\nthe before_save hook.\n\n== Unique features\n\n+xss_terminate+ is based on +acts_as_sanitized+. Here is what's different:\n\n* Rails 2.0-ready.\n* Automatic. It is included with default options in <tt>ActiveReord::Base</tt> so all your models are sanitized.\n* It works with migrations. Columns are fetched when model is saved, not when the class is loaded.\n* You can decide whether to sanitize or strip tags on a field-by-field basis instead of model-by-model.\n* HTML5lib support.\n\n== TODO\n\n* Performance tests\n* Test suites with \"real world\" HTML\n* Test/make work with Rails 1.2.x (Rails 1.2 sanitization is crap, so you'd want to use HTML5lib)\n\n== Credits\n\nWritten by {Luke Francl}[http://railspikes.com] and based on acts_as_sanitized by \n{Alex Payne}[http://www.al3x.net].\n\nHTML5Lib sanitization by {Jacques Distler}[http://golem.ph.utexas.edu/~distler].\n\n== License\n\nMIT License, except for lib/html5lib_sanitize.rb which is under the \nRuby license and copyright to Jacques Distler.\n\n",

    "Readme": "== Welcome to Rails\n\nRails is a web-application framework that includes everything needed to create \ndatabase-backed web applications according to the Model-View-Control pattern. \n\nThis pattern splits the view (also called the presentation) into \"dumb\" templates\nthat are primarily responsible for inserting pre-built data in between HTML tags.\nThe model contains the \"smart\" domain objects (such as Account, Product, Person,\nPost) that holds all the business logic and knows how to persist themselves to\na database. The controller handles the incoming requests (such as Save New Account,\nUpdate Product, Show Post) by manipulating the model and directing data to the view.\n\nIn Rails, the model is handled by what's called an object-relational mapping\nlayer entitled Active Record. This layer allows you to present the data from\ndatabase rows as objects and embellish these data objects with business logic\nmethods. You can read more about Active Record in\nlink:files/vendor/rails/activerecord/README.html.\n\nThe controller and view are handled by the Action Pack, which handles both\nlayers by its two parts: Action View and Action Controller. These two layers\nare bundled in a single package due to their heavy interdependence. This is\nunlike the relationship between the Active Record and Action Pack that is much\nmore separate. Each of these packages can be used independently outside of\nRails.  You can read more about Action Pack in\nlink:files/vendor/rails/actionpack/README.html.\n\n\n== Getting Started\n\n1. At the command prompt, start a new Rails application using the <tt>rails</tt> command\n   and your application name. Ex: rails myapp\n2. Change directory into myapp and start the web server: <tt>script/server</tt> (run with --help for options)\n3. Go to http://localhost:3000/ and get \"Welcome aboard: You're riding the Rails!\"\n4. Follow the guidelines to start developing your application\n\n\n== Web Servers\n\nBy default, Rails will try to use Mongrel if it's are installed when started with script/server, otherwise Rails will use WEBrick, the webserver that ships with Ruby. But you can also use Rails\nwith a variety of other web servers.\n\nMongrel is a Ruby-based webserver with a C component (which requires compilation) that is\nsuitable for development and deployment of Rails applications. If you have Ruby Gems installed,\ngetting up and running with mongrel is as easy as: <tt>gem install mongrel</tt>.\nMore info at: http://mongrel.rubyforge.org\n\nSay other Ruby web servers like Thin and Ebb or regular web servers like Apache or LiteSpeed or\nLighttpd or IIS. The Ruby web servers are run through Rack and the latter can either be setup to use\nFCGI or proxy to a pack of Mongrels/Thin/Ebb servers.\n\n== Apache .htaccess example for FCGI/CGI\n\n# General Apache options\nAddHandler fastcgi-script .fcgi\nAddHandler cgi-script .cgi\nOptions +FollowSymLinks +ExecCGI\n\n# If you don't want Rails to look in certain directories,\n# use the following rewrite rules so that Apache won't rewrite certain requests\n# \n# Example:\n#   RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} ^/notrails.*\n#   RewriteRule .* - [L]\n\n# Redirect all requests not available on the filesystem to Rails\n# By default the cgi dispatcher is used which is very slow\n# \n# For better performance replace the dispatcher with the fastcgi one\n#\n# Example:\n#   RewriteRule ^(.*)$ dispatch.fcgi [QSA,L]\nRewriteEngine On\n\n# If your Rails application is accessed via an Alias directive,\n# then you MUST also set the RewriteBase in this htaccess file.\n#\n# Example:\n#   Alias /myrailsapp /path/to/myrailsapp/public\n#   RewriteBase /myrailsapp\n\nRewriteRule ^$ index.html [QSA]\nRewriteRule ^([^.]+)$ $1.html [QSA]\nRewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f\nRewriteRule ^(.*)$ dispatch.cgi [QSA,L]\n\n# In case Rails experiences terminal errors\n# Instead of displaying this message you can supply a file here which will be rendered instead\n# \n# Example:\n#   ErrorDocument 500 /500.html\n\nErrorDocument 500 \"<h2>Application error</h2>Rails application failed to start properly\"\n\n\n== Debugging Rails\n\nSometimes your application goes wrong.  Fortunately there are a lot of tools that\nwill help you debug it and get it back on the rails.\n\nFirst area to check is the application log files.  Have \"tail -f\" commands running\non the server.log and development.log. Rails will automatically display debugging\nand runtime information to these files. Debugging info will also be shown in the\nbrowser on requests from 127.0.0.1.\n\nYou can also log your own messages directly into the log file from your code using\nthe Ruby logger class from inside your controllers. Example:\n\n  class WeblogController < ActionController::Base\n    def destroy\n      @weblog = Weblog.find(params[:id])\n      @weblog.destroy\n      logger.info(\"#{Time.now} Destroyed Weblog ID ##{@weblog.id}!\")\n    end\n  end\n\nThe result will be a message in your log file along the lines of:\n\n  Mon Oct 08 14:22:29 +1000 2007 Destroyed Weblog ID #1\n\nMore information on how to use the logger is at http://www.ruby-doc.org/core/\n\nAlso, Ruby documentation can be found at http://www.ruby-lang.org/ including:\n\n* The Learning Ruby (Pickaxe) Book: http://www.ruby-doc.org/docs/ProgrammingRuby/\n* Learn to Program: http://pine.fm/LearnToProgram/  (a beginners guide)\n\nThese two online (and free) books will bring you up to speed on the Ruby language\nand also on programming in general.\n\n\n== Debugger\n\nDebugger support is available through the debugger command when you start your Mongrel or\nWebrick server with --debugger. This means that you can break out of execution at any point\nin the code, investigate and change the model, AND then resume execution! \nYou need to install ruby-debug to run the server in debugging mode. With gems, use 'gem install ruby-debug'\nExample:\n\n  class WeblogController < ActionController::Base\n    def index\n      @posts = Post.find(:all)\n      debugger\n    end\n  end\n\nSo the controller will accept the action, run the first line, then present you\nwith a IRB prompt in the server window. Here you can do things like:\n\n  >> @posts.inspect\n  => \"[#<Post:0x14a6be8 @attributes={\\\"title\\\"=>nil, \\\"body\\\"=>nil, \\\"id\\\"=>\\\"1\\\"}>,\n       #<Post:0x14a6620 @attributes={\\\"title\\\"=>\\\"Rails you know!\\\", \\\"body\\\"=>\\\"Only ten..\\\", \\\"id\\\"=>\\\"2\\\"}>]\"\n  >> @posts.first.title = \"hello from a debugger\"\n  => \"hello from a debugger\"\n\n...and even better is that you can examine how your runtime objects actually work:\n\n  >> f = @posts.first\n  => #<Post:0x13630c4 @attributes={\"title\"=>nil, \"body\"=>nil, \"id\"=>\"1\"}>\n  >> f.\n  Display all 152 possibilities? (y or n)\n\nFinally, when you're ready to resume execution, you enter \"cont\"\n\n\n== Console\n\nYou can interact with the domain model by starting the console through <tt>script/console</tt>.\nHere you'll have all parts of the application configured, just like it is when the\napplication is running. You can inspect domain models, change values, and save to the\ndatabase. Starting the script without arguments will launch it in the development environment.\nPassing an argument will specify a different environment, like <tt>script/console production</tt>.\n\nTo reload your controllers and models after launching the console run <tt>reload!</tt>\n\n== dbconsole\n\nYou can go to the command line of your database directly through <tt>script/dbconsole</tt>.\nYou would be connected to the database with the credentials defined in database.yml.\nStarting the script without arguments will connect you to the development database. Passing an\nargument will connect you to a different database, like <tt>script/dbconsole production</tt>.\nCurrently works for mysql, postgresql and sqlite.\n\n== Description of Contents\n\napp\n  Holds all the code that's specific to this particular application.\n\napp/controllers\n  Holds controllers that should be named like weblogs_controller.rb for\n  automated URL mapping. All controllers should descend from ApplicationController\n  which itself descends from ActionController::Base.\n\napp/models\n  Holds models that should be named like post.rb.\n  Most models will descend from ActiveRecord::Base.\n\napp/views\n  Holds the template files for the view that should be named like\n  weblogs/index.html.erb for the WeblogsController#index action. All views use eRuby\n  syntax.\n\napp/views/layouts\n  Holds the template files for layouts to be used with views. This models the common\n  header/footer method of wrapping views. In your views, define a layout using the\n  <tt>layout :default</tt> and create a file named default.html.erb. Inside default.html.erb,\n  call <% yield %> to render the view using this layout.\n\napp/helpers\n  Holds view helpers that should be named like weblogs_helper.rb. These are generated\n  for you automatically when using script/generate for controllers. Helpers can be used to\n  wrap functionality for your views into methods.\n\nconfig\n  Configuration files for the Rails environment, the routing map, the database, and other dependencies.\n\ndb\n  Contains the database schema in schema.rb.  db/migrate contains all\n  the sequence of Migrations for your schema.\n\ndoc\n  This directory is where your application documentation will be stored when generated\n  using <tt>rake doc:app</tt>\n\nlib\n  Application specific libraries. Basically, any kind of custom code that doesn't\n  belong under controllers, models, or helpers. This directory is in the load path.\n\npublic\n  The directory available for the web server. Contains subdirectories for images, stylesheets,\n  and javascripts. Also contains the dispatchers and the default HTML files. This should be\n  set as the DOCUMENT_ROOT of your web server.\n\nscript\n  Helper scripts for automation and generation.\n\ntest\n  Unit and functional tests along with fixtures. When using the script/generate scripts, template\n  test files will be generated for you and placed in this directory.\n\nvendor\n  External libraries that the application depends on. Also includes the plugins subdirectory.\n  If the app has frozen rails, those gems also go here, under vendor/rails/.\n  This directory is in the load path.\n\n",

    "Readme": "Midi Control 1.1, a plugin for Winamp\n-------------------------------------\n\nThis Winamp plugin allows you to use a MIDI device, such as a keyboard,\nto control Winamp's functionality. Many musicians will have a MIDI\ndevice hooked up to their computer, and this can be made useful, even\nwhen not being used for its normal purpose.\n\nThis plugin allows access to all major Winamp functions by assigning\nthem to notes, which can then be generated by the keyboard. For example,\nD, in any octave, is Play. It also makes use of mod and pitch wheel messages,\nif present. For the rest of the assignments, please see the Midi Control\nconfiguration dialog.\n\nNew in Version 1.1\n------------------\n\n- Support for volume control via the keyboard (keys A and B)\n\n- Support for Tascam US-428 (CS-10 compatible) transport buttons.\n\n    *** big thanks to Loek for all your help!!! ***\n\n    - Main volume fader controls Winamp volume\n    - Locate L/R = skip back/forward song\n    - Rew/Fwd = 10 seconds back/forward\n    - Stop = stops Winamp\n    - Play = Toggles between Play and Pause\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\nUse the installer to install the plugin to your Winamp plugin directory,\nwhich defaults to c:\\Program Files\\Winamp\\Plugins. Restart Winamp. Winamp\nversions 2.0 and later are supported.\n\nUsage\n-----\n\nUse the configuration dialog:\n\nPreferences->Plugins->General Purpose->Midi Control and click Configure.\n\nThis dialog shows the various key assignments, and allows the MIDI port\nand channel to be chosen. Alternatively, the Autoconfigure feature can\nbe used if you don't remember what device or channel your MIDI device is\nsending on.\n\nLicensing\n---------\n\nThis software is Copyright 2004 Andrew Grover, and is freely redistributable\nand modifiable under the MIT License (see LICENSE).\n\nPlease feel free to contact me (andy@groveronline.com) with any comments or\nbug reports.\n\n",

    "Readme": "INTRODUCTION\nHello and welcome to Nu.\nI created Nu because I wanted a better way to write software.\nI wanted to write with a language as flexible and powerful as Lisp, but I \nalso wanted to be able to work with the many libraries and high-performance\nsubsystems written in C, including the ones that I write myself.  So a tight \nintegration with C was my highest priority; that ruled and drove the \nimplementation of Nu.  That's why Nu is \"C over lambda.\"\nIt is easier to integrate with C when you have a disciplined way of structuring \nC code.  Popular scripting languages (Python, Ruby, Lua, etc.) make many \nimplementation-dependent impositions on the C code that they call.  Their\nartifacts are often called \"glue code\" and are usually ugly, cumbersome, and \nunpleasant to generate.\nObjective-C provides a proven way of structuring C code that has no scripting \nlanguage implementation dependencies.  But it can do much more than that.\nObjective-C can also serve as a platform for a powerful dynamic language.\nNu was designed to take full advantage of that.  It was also designed to \nprovide many of the elements of successful scripting languages, notably \nRuby, while adding the syntactic simplicity and flexibility of Lisp.   \nLegal\nNu is copyrighted open-source software that is released under the Apache\nLicense, version 2.0.  For details on the license, see the LICENSE file.\nIn its use to name a programming language, \"Nu\" is a trademark of Radtastical \nInc.\nSystem Requirements\nOn Macintosh systems, Nu requires Mac OS X version 10.5 or greater.\nIt is also possible to build Nu to run on Linux systems and the \nApple iPhone.\nInstallation\nInstallation instructions are in the notes/INSTALL file.\nGoing Further\nnotes/DEMO contains a simple tutorial exercise that can acquaint you with Nu.\nnotes/USAGE describes a few of the ways that you can use Nu.\nnotes/ERRORS contains some pitfalls that I've encountered when programming \nwith Nu.\nnotes/TODO contains some open issues that I'd like to address in Nu.\nThe examples directory contains several fun and interesting examples.\nTextMate users can drag and drop share/Nu.tmbundle onto the TextMate \napplication icon to add Nu-specific features to TextMate.\nAuthor\nTim Burks (tim@radtastical.com)\nRadtastical Inc.\nPalo Alto, California, USA\nhttp://www.radtastical.com\n",

    "Readme": "Fumblerooski\nFumblerooski is a college football statistics application written in Python using the Django framework, based on data provided by the NCAA and editor input. Most statistics are from 2000 onward, although some teams have game scores dating back to 1988. The code here is licensed under the BSD license (see LICENSE for more details). As of August 2010, this repository is frozen as-is and will not be updated. For further development, check out https://github.com/gcaprio/cfbreference_com, which is based on the original Fumblerooski code base.\n\nRequirements\n\n\nPython 2.5+ (lower versions may work but are untested.)\nDjango 1.2+ (aggregates support required and settings use new multi-db syntax)\nBeautifulSoup (HTML and XML parsing)\ndjango-googlecharts (http://github.com/jacobian/django-googlecharts)\n\n\n\nOverview\nFumblerooski uses the NCAA's statistics site (http://web1.ncaa.org/mfb/mainpage.jsp?year=2009) as a base - nearly everything game and player-related derives from information parsed or scraped from this site. The NCAA provides game information in XML, but most other elements - rosters, drives and rankings included - are scraped using BeautifulSoup. Coaching information is based on an Excel file provided by the NCAA but supplemented by data entry for assistant coaches and coaching history back to 2000.\n\nSetup\nRename settings.py.example to settings.py, fill in the values for the admin, database, media location and template paths. There is a setting called CURRENT_SEASON that is set in settings.py and used in various places in the application. It is currently set to 2010.\n\nStructure\nFumblerooski is divided into several app or app-like structures. The main one is the college app, which contains most of the models and views, including those related to teams, games, coaches and players. The rankings and scrapers are split into their own directories as well, along with small API and blog apps.\n\nLoaders\nInformation from the NCAA is scraped using the files in scrapers/, which presently are very tied into the rest of the app, so running the loaders independent of the college app will not produce the desired effect (and will produce lots of errors). The NCAA produces an XML file for each completed game, but the remainder of the information used by Fumblerooski, including schedules, rosters and rankings are parsed using BeautifulSoup.\nThe main scraper library has three functions: full_load, full_nostats_load and partial_loader. Because of the need to scrape the HTML tables for an entire season, each of the loaders loops through each team marked to be updated (updated=True) and parses the schedule/results information. The full_load also creates drive and player stats, but those are not available until up to 12-15 hours after the end of the game, so a nostats load only records the score. Normally the full_load can be run on a Sunday afternoon to capture all of Saturday's games. It's also recommended that the load_roster scraper be run after a full_load, as it updates the number of games a player has played in. Rankings also tend to be updated on Sundays, so the team and player rankings can be run then, too.\n\nUtilities\nThe code includes several generic utilities of use in the app but which depend on the use of the scrapers to populate the database. These include functions to generate and update CollegeYear instances, identify conference games and populate Week instances.\n",

    "Readme": "= AssetPackager\n\nJavaScript and CSS Asset Compression for Production Rails Apps\n\n== Description\n\nWhen it comes time to deploy your new web application, instead of \nsending down a dozen JavaScript and CSS files full of formatting \nand comments, this Rails plugin makes it simple to merge and \ncompress JavaScript and CSS down into one or more files, increasing \nspeed and saving bandwidth.\n\nWhen in development, it allows you to use your original versions \nand retain formatting and comments for readability and debugging.\n\nThis code is released under the MIT license (like Ruby). You're free \nto rip it up, enhance it, etc. And if you make any enhancements, \nI'd like to know so I can add them back in. Thanks!\n\n* Formerly known as MergeJS.\n\n== Credit\n\nThis Rails Plugin was inspired by Cal Henderson's article \n\"Serving JavaScript Fast\" on Vitamin:\nhttp://www.thinkvitamin.com/features/webapps/serving-javascript-fast\n\nIt also uses the Ruby JavaScript Minifier created by \nDouglas Crockford.\nhttp://www.crockford.com/javascript/jsmin.html\n\n== Key Features\n\n* Merges and compresses JavaScript and CSS when running in production.\n* Uses uncompressed originals when running in development.\n* Generates packages on demand in production\n\n== Components\n\n* Rake tasks for managing packages\n* Helper functions for including these JavaScript and CSS files in your views.\n* YAML configuration file for mapping JavaScript and CSS files to packages.\n* Rake Task for auto-generating the YAML file from your existing JavaScript files.\n\n== Updates\n\nNovember '08:\n* Rails 2.2 compatibility fixes\n* No more mucking with internal Rails functions, which means:\n  * Return to use of query-string timestamps. Greatly simplifies things.\n  * Multiple asset-hosts supported\n  * Filenames with \".\"'s in them, such as \"jquery-x.x.x\" are supported.\n* Now compatible with any revision control system since it no longer uses revision numbers.\n* Packages generated on demand in production mode. Running create_all rake task no longer necessary.\n\n== How to Use:\n\n1. Download and install the plugin:\n   ./script/plugin install git://github.com/sbecker/asset_packager.git\n\n2. Run the rake task \"asset:packager:create_yml\" to generate the /config/asset_packages.yml\nfile the first time. You will need to reorder files under 'base' so dependencies are loaded \nin correct order. Feel free to rename or create new file packages.\n\nIMPORTANT: JavaScript files can break once compressed if each statement doesn't end with a semi-colon.\nThe minifier puts multiple statements on one line, so if the semi-colon is missing, the statement may no \nlonger makes sense and cause a syntax error.\n\n== Examples of config/asset_packages.yml\n\nExample from a fresh rails app after running the rake task. (Stylesheets is blank because a \ndefault rails app has no stylesheets yet.):\n\n--- \njavascripts: \n- base: \n  - prototype\n  - effects\n  - dragdrop\n  - controls\n  - application\nstylesheets: \n- base: []\n\nMultiple packages:\n\n---\njavascripts:\n- base:\n  - prototype\n  - effects\n  - controls\n  - dragdrop\n  - application\n- secondary:\n  - foo\n  - bar\nstylesheets:\n- base:\n  - screen\n  - header\n- secondary:\n  - foo\n  - bar\n\n3. Run the rake task \"asset:packager:build_all\" to generate the compressed, merged versions\nfor each package. Whenever you rearrange the yaml file, you'll need to run this task again. \n\nMerging and compressing is expensive, so this is something we want to do once, not every time\nyour app starts. Thats why its a rake task. You can run this task via Capistrano when deploying\nto avoid an initially slow request the first time a page is generated. \n\nNote: The package will be generated on the fly if it doesn't yet exist, so you don't *need* \nto run the rake task when deploying, its just recommended for speeding up initial requests.\n\n4. Use the helper functions whenever including these files in your application. See below for examples.\n\n5. Potential warning: css compressor function currently removes CSS comments. This might blow\naway some CSS hackery. To disable comment removal, comment out /lib/synthesis/asset_package.rb line 176.\n\n== JavaScript Examples\n\nExample call (based on above /config/asset_packages.yml):\n  <%= javascript_include_merged :base %>\n\nIn development, this generates: \n  <script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"/javascripts/prototype.js?1228027240\"></script>\n  <script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"/javascripts/effects.js?1228027240\"></script>\n  <script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"/javascripts/controls.js?1228027240\"></script>\n  <script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"/javascripts/dragdrop.js?1228027240\"></script>\n  <script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"/javascripts/application.js?1228027240\"></script>\n\nIn production, this generates: \n  <script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"/javascripts/base_packaged.js?123456789\"></script>\n\n== Stylesheet Examples\n\nExample call:\n  <%= stylesheet_link_merged :base %>\n\nIn development, this generates:\n  <link href=\"/stylesheets/screen.css?1228027240\" media=\"screen\" rel=\"Stylesheet\" type=\"text/css\" />\n  <link href=\"/stylesheets/header.css?1228027240\" media=\"screen\" rel=\"Stylesheet\" type=\"text/css\" />\n\nIn production this generates:\n  <link href=\"/stylesheets/base_packaged.css?1228027240\" media=\"screen\" rel=\"Stylesheet\" type=\"text/css\" />\n\n== Different CSS Media\n\nAll options for stylesheet_link_tag still work, so if you want to specify a different media type:\n  <%= stylesheet_link_merged :secondary, 'media' => 'print' %>\n\n== Rake tasks\n\nrake asset:packager:build_all        # Merge and compress assets\nrake asset:packager:create_yml       # Generate asset_packages.yml from existing assets\nrake asset:packager:delete_all       # Delete all asset builds\n\n== Running the tests\n\nThis plugin has a full suite of tests. But since they\ndepend on rails, it has to be run in the context of a\nrails app, in the vendor/plugins directory. Observe:\n\n> rails newtestapp\n> cd newtestapp\n> ./script/plugin install ./script/plugin install git://github.com/sbecker/asset_packager.git\n> rake test:plugins PLUGIN=asset_packager # all tests pass\n\n== License\nCopyright (c) 2006-2008 Scott Becker - http://synthesis.sbecker.net\nContact via Github for change requests, etc.\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

On my local machine this wasn't a problem, but on my hosting server the\nruby apps would crash because of their 100MB memory limit.\nSolution!\nUsing MiniMagick the ruby processes memory remains small (it spawns\nImageMagick's command line program mogrify which takes up some memory as well,\nbut is much smaller compared to RMagick). See Thinking of switching from\nRMagick? below.\nMiniMagick gives you access to all the command line options ImageMagick has\n(found here).\nRequirements\nImageMagick or GraphicsMagick command-line tool has to be installed.

We then\nresize\nthe image, and write it to a file. The writing part is necessary because\nthe copy is just temporary, it gets garbage collected when we lose reference\nto the image.\nMiniMagick::Image.open also accepts URLs.\nimage = MiniMagick::Image.open(\"http://example.com/image.jpg\")\nimage.contrast\nimage.write(\"from_internets.jpg\")\nOn the other hand, if we want the original image to actually get modified,\nwe can use MiniMagick::Image.new.\nimage = MiniMagick::Image.new(\"input.jpg\")\nimage.path #=> \"input.jpg\"\nimage.resize \"100x100\"\n# No calling #write, because it's no a copy\nCombine options\nWhile using methods like #resize directly is convenient, if we use more\nmethods in this way, it quickly becomes inefficient, because it calls the\ncommand on each methods call. MiniMagick::Image#combine_options takes\nmultiple options and from them builds one single command.\nimage.combine_options do |b|\n  b.resize \"250x200>\"\n  b.rotate \"-90\"\n  b.flip\nend # the command gets executed\nAs a handy shortcut, MiniMagick::Image.new also accepts an optional block\nwhich is used to combine_options.\nimage = MiniMagick::Image.new(\"input.jpg\") do |b|\n  b.resize \"250x200>\"\n  b.rotate \"-90\"\n  b.flip\nend # the command gets executed\nThe yielded builder is an instance of MiniMagick::Tool::Mogrify. To learn more\nabout its interface, see Metal below.\nAttributes\nA MiniMagick::Image has various handy attributes.\nimage.type        #=> \"JPEG\"\nimage.mime_type   #=> \"image/jpeg\"\nimage.width       #=> 250\nimage.height      #=> 300\nimage.dimensions  #=> [250, 300]\nimage.size        #=> 3451 (in bytes)\nimage.colorspace  #=> \"DirectClass sRGB\"\nimage.exif        #=> {\"DateTimeOriginal\" => \"2013:09:04 08:03:39\", ...}\nimage.resolution  #=> [75, 75]\nimage.signature   #=> \"60a7848c4ca6e36b8e2c5dea632ecdc29e9637791d2c59ebf7a54c0c6a74ef7e\"\nIf you need more control, you can also access raw image\nattributes:\nimage[\"%[gamma]\"] # \"0.9\"\nTo get the all information about the image, MiniMagick gives you a handy method\n(which just converts the output from identify -verbose into a Hash):\nimage.details #=> {\"Format\" => \"JPEG\", \"Mime type\" => \"image/jpeg\", \"Resolution\" => \"300x300\", ...}\nConfiguration\nMiniMagick.configure do |config|\n  config.cli = :graphicsmagick\n  config.timeout = 5\nend\nFor a complete list of configuration options, see\nConfiguration.\nComposite\nMiniMagick also allows you to\ncomposite images:\nfirst_image  = MiniMagick::Image.new(\"first.jpg\")\nsecond_image = MiniMagick::Image.new(\"second.jpg\")\nresult = first_image.composite(second_image) do |c|\n  c.compose \"Over\"    # OverCompositeOp\n  c.geometry \"+20+20\" # copy second_image onto first_image from (20, 20)\nend\nresult.write \"output.jpg\"\nLayers/Frames/Pages\nFor multilayered images you can access its layers.\ngif.frames #=> [...]\npdf.pages  #=> [...]\npsd.layers #=> [...]\n\ngif.frames.each_with_index do |frame, idx|\n  frame.write(\"frame#{idx}.jpg\")\nend\nImage validation\nBy default, MiniMagick validates images each time it's opening them. It\nvalidates them by running identify on them, and see if ImageMagick finds\nthem valid. This adds slight overhead to the whole processing. Sometimes it's\nsafe to assume that all input and output images are valid by default and turn\noff validation:\nMiniMagick.configure do |config|\n  config.validate_on_create = false\n  config.validate_on_write = false\nend\nYou can test whether an image is valid:\nimage.valid?\nimage.validate! # raises MiniMagick::Invalid if image is invalid\nLogging\nYou can choose to log MiniMagick commands and their execution times:\nMiniMagick.logger.level = Logger::DEBUG\nD, [2016-03-19T07:31:36.755338 #87191] DEBUG -- : [0.01s] identify /var/folders/k7/6zx6dx6x7ys3rv3srh0nyfj00000gn/T/mini_magick20160319-87191-1ve31n1.jpg\n\nIn Rails you'll probably want to set MiniMagick.logger = Rails.logger.\nSwitching CLIs (ImageMagick <=> GraphicsMagick)\nDefault CLI is ImageMagick, but if you want to use GraphicsMagick, you can\nspecify it in configuration:\nMiniMagick.configure do |config|\n  config.cli = :graphicsmagick\nend\nIf you're a real ImageMagick guru, you might want to use GraphicsMagick only\nfor certain processing blocks (because it's more efficient), or vice versa. You\ncan accomplish this with .with_cli:\nMiniMagick.with_cli(:graphicsmagick) do\n  # Some processing that GraphicsMagick is better at\nend\nWARNING: If you're building a multithreaded web application, you should\nchange the CLI only on application startup. This is because the configuration is\nglobal, so if you change it in a controller action, other threads in the same\nprocess will also have their CLI changed, which could lead to race conditions.\nMetal\nIf you want to be close to the metal, you can use ImageMagick's command-line\ntools directly.\nMiniMagick::Tool::Mogrify.new do |mogrify|\n  mogrify.resize(\"100x100\")\n  mogrify.negate\n  mogrify << \"image.jpg\"\nend #=> `mogrify -resize 100x100 -negate image.jpg`\n\n# OR\n\nmogrify = MiniMagick::Tool::Mogrify.new\nmogrify.resize(\"100x100\")\nmogrify.negate\nmogrify << \"image.jpg\"\nmogrify.call #=> `mogrify -resize 100x100 -negate image.jpg`\nThis way of using MiniMagick is highly recommended if you want to maximize\nperformance of your image processing. Here are some of the features.\nAppending\nThe most basic way of building a command is appending strings:\nMiniMagick::Tool::Convert.new do |convert|\n  convert << \"input.jpg\"\n  convert.merge! [\"-resize\", \"500x500\", \"-negate\"]\n  convert << \"output.jpg\"\nend\nNote that it is important that every command you would pass to the command line\nhas to be separated with <<, e.g.:\n# GOOD\nconvert << \"-resize\" << \"500x500\"\n\n# BAD\nconvert << \"-resize 500x500\"\nShell escaping is also handled for you. If an option has a value that has\nspaces inside it, just pass it as a regular string.\nconvert << \"-distort\"\nconvert << \"Perspective\"\nconvert << \"0,0,0,0 0,45,0,45 69,0,60,10 69,45,60,35\"\nconvert -distort Perspective '0,0,0,0 0,45,0,45 69,0,60,10 69,45,60,35'\n\nMethods\nInstead of passing in options directly, you can use Ruby methods:\nconvert.resize(\"500x500\")\nconvert.rotate(90)\nconvert.distort(\"Perspective\", \"0,0,0,0 0,45,0,45 69,0,60,10 69,45,60,35\")\nMiniMagick knows which options each tool has, so you will get an explicit\nNoMethodError if you happen to have mispelled an option.\nChaining\nEvery method call returns self, so you can chain them to create logical groups.\nMiniMagick::Tool::Convert.new do |convert|\n  convert << \"input.jpg\"\n  convert.clone(0).background('gray').shadow('80x5+5+5')\n  convert.negate\n  convert << \"output.jpg\"\nend\n\"Plus\" options\nMiniMagick::Tool::Convert.new do |convert|\n  convert << \"input.jpg\"\n  convert.repage.+\n  convert.distort.+(\"Perspective\", \"more args\")\nend\nconvert input.jpg +repage +distort Perspective 'more args'\n\nStacks\nMiniMagick::Tool::Convert.new do |convert|\n  convert << \"wand.gif\"\n  convert.stack do |stack|\n    stack << \"wand.gif\"\n    stack.rotate(30)\n  end\n  convert << \"images.gif\"\nend\nconvert wand.gif \\( wand.gif -rotate 90 \\) images.gif\n\nPassing STDIN\nIf you want to pass something to standard input, you can pass the :stdin\noption to #call:\nidentify = MiniMagick::Tool::Identify.new\nidentify.stdin # alias for `identify << \"-\"`\nidentify.call(stdin: image_content)\nCapturing STDERR\nSome MiniMagick tools such as compare output the result of the command on\nstandard error, even if the command succeeded. The result of\nMiniMagick::Tool#call is always the standard output, but if you pass it a\nblock, it will yield the stdout, stderr and exit status of the command:\ncompare = MiniMagick::Tool::Compare.new\n# build the command\ncompare.call do |stdout, stderr, status|\n  # ...\nend\nLimiting resources\nImageMagick supports a number of environment variables for controlling its\nresource limits. For example, you can enfore memory or execution time limits by\nsetting the following variables in your application's process environment:\n\nMAGICK_MEMORY_LIMIT=128MiB\nMAGICK_MAP_LIMIT=64MiB\nMAGICK_TIME_LIMIT=30\n\nFor a full list of variables and description, see ImageMagick's resources\ndocumentation.\nTroubleshooting\nErrors being raised when they shouldn't\nThis gem raises an error when ImageMagick returns a nonzero exit code.\nSometimes, however, ImageMagick returns nonzero exit codes when the command\nactually went ok. In these cases, to avoid raising errors, you can add the\nfollowing configuration:\nMiniMagick.configure do |config|\n  config.whiny = false\nend\nIf you're using the tool directly, you can pass whiny: false value to the\nconstructor:\nMiniMagick::Tool::Identify.new(whiny: false) do |b|\n  b.help\nend\nErrno::ENOMEM\nIt can happen that, when dealing with very large images, the process runs out of\nmemory, and Errno::ENOMEM is raised in your code. In that case try installing\nthe posix-spawn gem, and tell MiniMagick\nto use it when executing shell commands.\nMiniMagick.configure do |config|\n  config.shell_api = \"posix-spawn\"\nend\nThinking of switching from RMagick?\nUnlike RMagick, MiniMagick is a much thinner wrapper around ImageMagick.\n\nTo piece together MiniMagick commands refer to the Mogrify\nDocumentation. For instance\nyou can use the -flop option as image.flop.\nOperations on a MiniMagick image tend to happen in-place as image.trim,\nwhereas RMagick has both copying and in-place methods like image.trim and\nimage.trim!.\nTo open files with MiniMagick you use MiniMagick::Image.open as you would\nMagick::Image.read. To open a file and directly edit it, use\nMiniMagick::Image.new.\n\n",

Once you have\ncreated a repository object, you can traverse it to find parent commit(s),\ntrees, blobs, etc.\n\n= Initialize a Repo object\n\nThe first step is to create a Grit::Repo object to represent your repo. I\ninclude the Grit module so reduce typing.\n\n  include Grit\n  repo = Repo.new(\"/Users/tom/dev/grit\")\n\nIn the above example, the directory /Users/tom/dev/grit is my working\nrepo and contains the .git directory. You can also initialize Grit with a \nbare repo.\n\n  repo = Repo.new(\"/var/git/grit.git\")\n\n= Getting a list of commits\n\nFrom the Repo object, you can get a list of commits as an array of Commit\nobjects.\n\n  repo.commits\n  # => [#<Grit::Commit \"e80bbd2ce67651aa18e57fb0b43618ad4baf7750\">,\n        #<Grit::Commit \"91169e1f5fa4de2eaea3f176461f5dc784796769\">,\n        #<Grit::Commit \"038af8c329ef7c1bae4568b98bd5c58510465493\">,\n        #<Grit::Commit \"40d3057d09a7a4d61059bca9dca5ae698de58cbe\">,\n        #<Grit::Commit \"4ea50f4754937bf19461af58ce3b3d24c77311d9\">]\n\nCalled without arguments, Repo#commits returns a list of up to ten commits\nreachable by the master branch (starting at the latest commit). You can ask\nfor commits beginning at a different branch, commit, tag, etc.\n\n  repo.commits('mybranch')\n  repo.commits('40d3057d09a7a4d61059bca9dca5ae698de58cbe')\n  repo.commits('v0.1')\n\nYou can specify the maximum number of commits to return.\n\n  repo.commits('master', 100)\n\nIf you need paging, you can specify a number of commits to skip.\n\n  repo.commits('master', 10, 20)\n\nThe above will return commits 21-30 from the commit list.\n\n= The Commit object\n\nCommit objects contain information about that commit.\n\n  head = repo.commits.first\n\n  head.id\n  # => \"e80bbd2ce67651aa18e57fb0b43618ad4baf7750\"\n\n  head.parents\n  # => [#<Grit::Commit \"91169e1f5fa4de2eaea3f176461f5dc784796769\">]\n\n  head.tree\n  # => #<Grit::Tree \"3536eb9abac69c3e4db583ad38f3d30f8db4771f\">\n\n  head.author\n  # => #<Grit::Actor \"Tom Preston-Werner <tom@mojombo.com>\">\n\n  head.authored_date\n  # => Wed Oct 24 22:02:31 -0700 2007\n\n  head.committer\n  # => #<Grit::Actor \"Tom Preston-Werner <tom@mojombo.com>\">\n\n  head.committed_date\n  # => Wed Oct 24 22:02:31 -0700 2007\n\n  head.message\n  # => \"add Actor inspect\"\n\nYou can traverse a commit's ancestry by chaining calls to #parents.\n\n  repo.commits.first.parents[0].parents[0].parents[0]\n\nThe above corresponds to master^^^ or master~3 in git parlance.\n\n= The Tree object\n\nA tree records pointers to the contents of a directory.

Here are some examples (which assume you have bound polypage to the 'body')...\nToggle the logged in state...\n$('body').trigger('pp_toggleState', 'logged_in');\n\nSet the logged in state...\n$('body').trigger('pp_setState', { logged_in:true });\n\nSet the logged in state...\n$('body').trigger('pp_setState', { logged_in:true });\n\nListen for state changes...\n$('body').bind('pp_stateChange', function(e, state) { \n  alert(\"state \"+ state.name + \" changed to \" + state.value); \n});\n\nSee the specs for some more examples.\nADVANCED USAGE\nUnder the hood PolyPage is logically separated into a core library and several extensions. The currently implemented extensions are...\n\nBase: the core event system and bare essentials to get polypage working\nGUI: the nav bar for pre-built GUI interactions\nEvents: some default event handlers for taking care of polypage formatted click and submit events automagically\nCookies: cookie support for maintaining state across pages\nKeyboard: Keyboard shortcuts for toggling states via \"ALT + first_letter_of_state_name\"\n\nFull documentation for all of the extensions will be coming soon but for now you can see the source code for available options.\nSome usage examples\nStarting PolyPage without cookie support or Event helpers...\n$('body').polypage({ cookie:false, events:false });\n\nStarting PolyPage with a 2 day cookie expiry a 'ux' prefix and no Event helpers...\n$('body').polypage({ prefix:'ux', cookie:{ expires:2 }, events:false });\n\nRoll your own PolyPage! if you want to completely customise PolyPage then you can break away from using the polypage() function and initialize the individual components yourself...\n$(el).ppBase(opts);\n$(el).ppEvents(opts);\n$(el).ppGUI(opts);\n$(el).ppCookie(opts);\n$(el).ppKeyboard(opts);\n\nMORE INFO\nFor an example open the index.html file in a web browser.\nIf you would prefer be using MooTools instead of jQuery then for the moment you really should checkout cheeaun's fork http://github.com/cheeaun/polypage which contains lots of MooTools goodness.\nCONTRIBUTERS\n\nAndy Kent andy.kent@me.com (http://adkent.com)\nNatalie Downe nat@natbat.net (http://notes.natbat.net)\nPhil Oye philoye@philoye.com (http://philoye.com)\nLim Chee Aun cheeaun@gmail.com (http://cheeaun.com)\nYoan Blanc yoan@dosimple.ch (http://yoan.dosimple.ch/)\n\n",

The price is\ndefine in first for this present.\n\nBefore WhoToWho, we made a group before the Christmas night and we made a\nrandom choice of who must offer to who. The choice is made with little paper\nin hat.\n\nNow we are in different place and we can't see every week. So, like we have\nall an email, I created WhoToWho. So I can't know who must be offer to who and\nit's a total random.\n\nYes, WhoToWho is useless. But What is really usefull?\n\n== DESCRIPTION:\n\nWhoToWho is a simple script to define a name randomly in list of name. And\nsend this name by email. With WhoToWho you can define several thing:\n\n * Subject of Mail\n * Format of Mail with 2 parameters (who and towho)\n * The configuration of smtp connection\n * Add options for SSL if your smtp connection is a Gmail account\n\n== FEATURES:\n\n * Randomize a list and choice one persone for another\n * Send an email who the personne know who is define to it\n * Define the subject and the content of mail with 2 places for define word\n * who and to who\n * Possibility to exclude one or several person for another. With this\n   feature, one person can't have another person define.\n\n== SYNOPSIS:\n\nUsage: ./whotowho.rb [options]\n  -v, --verbose                    Run verbosely\n  -f, --file FILE                  File where is all data\n  -c, --config FILE                File where is all config\n  -g, --gmail                      Define option if use a Gmail account for SMTP\n  -s, --subject SUBJECT            Define the subject to send by email\n  -m, --mail MAIL                  Send a file where the content is with 2 params #{who} and #{towho}\n\n== REQUIREMENT:\n\n * ActionMailer from Ruby On Rails project : gem install actionmailer\n\n== INSTALL:\n\n= Archive *.tar.gz\n\n * Install actionmailer before\n * Untar the archive\n * Go to bin directory\n * Start command whotowho\n\n= Gem\n\n * gem install whotowho\n\n== Example of command\n\nruby whotowho -m mail-example.txt -s 'a good subject' -f ../data.yaml -c conf.yaml -g\n\n== Example of File configuration\n\n= File data example\n\nThis file define the list of name and email. The format of this file is YAML. It's the serialization of an Array of an Array in Ruby. A example of format is :\n\n- - name\n  - email\n- - name2\n  - email2\n- - name3\n  - email3\n\nIf you want define an exclude person to another you need had an Exclude list to the key exclude after email, like following :\n\n- - name\n  - email\n  - :exclude: - name2\n- - name2\n  - email2\n  - :exclude: - name5\n              - name6\n- - name3\n  - email3\n- - name4\n  - email4\n- - name5\n  - email5\n- - name6\n  - email6\n\n= File of mail configuration\n\nIt's the same of actionmailer. But I have add a configuration of from. You need had :from:\n\n:address: Allows you to use a remote mail server. Just change it from its default \"localhost\" setting.\n:port: On the off chance that your mail server doesn\u2018t run on port 25, you can change it.\n:domain: If you need to specify a HELO domain, you can do it here.\n:user_name: If your mail server requires authentication, set the username in this setting.\n:password: If your mail server requires authentication, set the password in this setting.\n:authentication: If your mail server requires authentication, you need to specify the authentication type here. This is a symbol and one of :plain, :login, :cram_md5\n:from: Define the email who send all mail in from header\n\n= File of mail content\n\nThis file is a simple text file. You have two patterns who change before the send.\n\n * #{who} : it's the name of person who receiv the mail\n * #{towho} : the name of person assign to personne who receiv this mail\n\n== LICENSE:\n\nThis code is free to use under the terms of the MIT license.\n\n",

    "Readme": "== Welcome to Rails\n\nRails is a web-application and persistence framework that includes everything\nneeded to create database-backed web-applications according to the\nModel-View-Control pattern of separation. This pattern splits the view (also\ncalled the presentation) into \"dumb\" templates that are primarily responsible\nfor inserting pre-built data in between HTML tags. The model contains the\n\"smart\" domain objects (such as Account, Product, Person, Post) that holds all\nthe business logic and knows how to persist themselves to a database. The\ncontroller handles the incoming requests (such as Save New Account, Update\nProduct, Show Post) by manipulating the model and directing data to the view.\n\nIn Rails, the model is handled by what's called an object-relational mapping\nlayer entitled Active Record. This layer allows you to present the data from\ndatabase rows as objects and embellish these data objects with business logic\nmethods. You can read more about Active Record in\nlink:files/vendor/rails/activerecord/README.html.\n\nThe controller and view are handled by the Action Pack, which handles both\nlayers by its two parts: Action View and Action Controller. These two layers\nare bundled in a single package due to their heavy interdependence. This is\nunlike the relationship between the Active Record and Action Pack that is much\nmore separate. Each of these packages can be used independently outside of\nRails.  You can read more about Action Pack in\nlink:files/vendor/rails/actionpack/README.html.\n\n\n== Getting Started\n\n1. At the command prompt, start a new Rails application using the <tt>rails</tt> command\n   and your application name. Ex: rails myapp\n   (If you've downloaded Rails in a complete tgz or zip, this step is already done)\n2. Change directory into myapp and start the web server: <tt>script/server</tt> (run with --help for options)\n3. Go to http://localhost:3000/ and get \"Welcome aboard: You\u2019re riding the Rails!\"\n4. Follow the guidelines to start developing your application\n\n\n== Web Servers\n\nBy default, Rails will try to use Mongrel and lighttpd if they are installed, otherwise\nRails will use WEBrick, the webserver that ships with Ruby. When you run script/server,\nRails will check if Mongrel exists, then lighttpd and finally fall back to WEBrick. This ensures\nthat you can always get up and running quickly.\n\nMongrel is a Ruby-based webserver with a C component (which requires compilation) that is\nsuitable for development and deployment of Rails applications. If you have Ruby Gems installed,\ngetting up and running with mongrel is as easy as: <tt>gem install mongrel</tt>.\nMore info at: http://mongrel.rubyforge.org\n\nIf Mongrel is not installed, Rails will look for lighttpd. It's considerably faster than\nMongrel and WEBrick and also suited for production use, but requires additional\ninstallation and currently only works well on OS X/Unix (Windows users are encouraged\nto start with Mongrel). We recommend version 1.4.11 and higher. You can download it from\nhttp://www.lighttpd.net.\n\nAnd finally, if neither Mongrel or lighttpd are installed, Rails will use the built-in Ruby\nweb server, WEBrick. WEBrick is a small Ruby web server suitable for development, but not\nfor production.\n\nBut of course its also possible to run Rails on any platform that supports FCGI.\nApache, LiteSpeed, IIS are just a few. For more information on FCGI,\nplease visit: http://wiki.rubyonrails.com/rails/pages/FastCGI\n\n\n== Debugging Rails\n\nSometimes your application goes wrong.  Fortunately there are a lot of tools that\nwill help you debug it and get it back on the rails.\n\nFirst area to check is the application log files.  Have \"tail -f\" commands running\non the server.log and development.log. Rails will automatically display debugging\nand runtime information to these files. Debugging info will also be shown in the\nbrowser on requests from 127.0.0.1.\n\nYou can also log your own messages directly into the log file from your code using\nthe Ruby logger class from inside your controllers. Example:\n\n  class WeblogController < ActionController::Base\n    def destroy\n      @weblog = Weblog.find(params[:id])\n      @weblog.destroy\n      logger.info(\"#{Time.now} Destroyed Weblog ID ##{@weblog.id}!\")\n    end\n  end\n\nThe result will be a message in your log file along the lines of:\n\n  Mon Oct 08 14:22:29 +1000 2007 Destroyed Weblog ID #1\n\nMore information on how to use the logger is at http://www.ruby-doc.org/core/\n\nAlso, Ruby documentation can be found at http://www.ruby-lang.org/ including:\n\n* The Learning Ruby (Pickaxe) Book: http://www.ruby-doc.org/docs/ProgrammingRuby/\n* Learn to Program: http://pine.fm/LearnToProgram/  (a beginners guide)\n\nThese two online (and free) books will bring you up to speed on the Ruby language\nand also on programming in general.\n\n\n== Debugger\n\nDebugger support is available through the debugger command when you start your Mongrel or\nWebrick server with --debugger. This means that you can break out of execution at any point\nin the code, investigate and change the model, AND then resume execution! Example:\n\n  class WeblogController < ActionController::Base\n    def index\n      @posts = Post.find(:all)\n      debugger\n    end\n  end\n\nSo the controller will accept the action, run the first line, then present you\nwith a IRB prompt in the server window. Here you can do things like:\n\n  >> @posts.inspect\n  => \"[#<Post:0x14a6be8 @attributes={\\\"title\\\"=>nil, \\\"body\\\"=>nil, \\\"id\\\"=>\\\"1\\\"}>,\n       #<Post:0x14a6620 @attributes={\\\"title\\\"=>\\\"Rails you know!\\\", \\\"body\\\"=>\\\"Only ten..\\\", \\\"id\\\"=>\\\"2\\\"}>]\"\n  >> @posts.first.title = \"hello from a debugger\"\n  => \"hello from a debugger\"\n\n...and even better is that you can examine how your runtime objects actually work:\n\n  >> f = @posts.first\n  => #<Post:0x13630c4 @attributes={\"title\"=>nil, \"body\"=>nil, \"id\"=>\"1\"}>\n  >> f.\n  Display all 152 possibilities? (y or n)\n\nFinally, when you're ready to resume execution, you enter \"cont\"\n\n\n== Console\n\nYou can interact with the domain model by starting the console through <tt>script/console</tt>.\nHere you'll have all parts of the application configured, just like it is when the\napplication is running. You can inspect domain models, change values, and save to the\ndatabase. Starting the script without arguments will launch it in the development environment.\nPassing an argument will specify a different environment, like <tt>script/console production</tt>.\n\nTo reload your controllers and models after launching the console run <tt>reload!</tt>\n\n\n== Description of Contents\n\napp\n  Holds all the code that's specific to this particular application.\n\napp/controllers\n  Holds controllers that should be named like weblogs_controller.rb for\n  automated URL mapping. All controllers should descend from ApplicationController\n  which itself descends from ActionController::Base.\n\napp/models\n  Holds models that should be named like post.rb.\n  Most models will descend from ActiveRecord::Base.\n\napp/views\n  Holds the template files for the view that should be named like\n  weblogs/index.erb for the WeblogsController#index action. All views use eRuby\n  syntax.\n\napp/views/layouts\n  Holds the template files for layouts to be used with views. This models the common\n  header/footer method of wrapping views. In your views, define a layout using the\n  <tt>layout :default</tt> and create a file named default.erb. Inside default.erb,\n  call <% yield %> to render the view using this layout.\n\napp/helpers\n  Holds view helpers that should be named like weblogs_helper.rb. These are generated\n  for you automatically when using script/generate for controllers. Helpers can be used to\n  wrap functionality for your views into methods.\n\nconfig\n  Configuration files for the Rails environment, the routing map, the database, and other dependencies.\n\ndb\n  Contains the database schema in schema.rb.  db/migrate contains all\n  the sequence of Migrations for your schema.\n\ndoc\n  This directory is where your application documentation will be stored when generated\n  using <tt>rake doc:app</tt>\n\nlib\n  Application specific libraries.

So ExecCGI\nshould be on and \".cgi\" should respond. All requests from 127.0.0.1 go\nthrough CGI, so no Apache restart is necessary for changes. All other requests\ngo through FCGI (or mod_ruby), which requires a restart to show changes.\n\n\n== Debugging Rails\n\nHave \"tail -f\" commands running on both the server.log, production.log, and\ntest.log files.

Here you can do things like:\n\nExecuting breakpoint \"Breaking out from the list\" at .../webrick_server.rb:16 in 'breakpoint'\n\n  >> @posts.inspect\n  => \"[#<Post:0x14a6be8 @attributes={\\\"title\\\"=>nil, \\\"body\\\"=>nil, \\\"id\\\"=>\\\"1\\\"}>, \n       #<Post:0x14a6620 @attributes={\\\"title\\\"=>\\\"Rails you know!\\\", \\\"body\\\"=>\\\"Only ten..\\\", \\\"id\\\"=>\\\"2\\\"}>]\"\n  >> @posts.first.title = \"hello from a breakpoint\"\n  => \"hello from a breakpoint\"\n\n...and even better is that you can examine how your runtime objects actually work:\n\n  >> f = @posts.first \n  => #<Post:0x13630c4 @attributes={\"title\"=>nil, \"body\"=>nil, \"id\"=>\"1\"}>\n  >> f.\n  Display all 152 possibilities?

This compiler runs quickly, generates\ncompact code with moderate memory requirements, and is portable to\nessentially any 32 or 64 bit Unix platform. Performance of generated\nprograms is quite good for a bytecoded implementation.  This compiler\ncan be used either as a standalone, batch-oriented compiler that\nproduces standalone programs, or as an interactive, toplevel-based\nsystem.\n\nThe other compiler generates high-performance native code for a number\nof processors. Compilation takes longer and generates bigger code, but\nthe generated programs deliver excellent performance, while retaining\nthe moderate memory requirements of the bytecode compiler. The\nnative-code compiler currently runs on the following platforms:\n\nTier 1 (actively used and maintained by the core OCaml team):\n\n    AMD64 (Opteron)    Linux, MacOS X, MS Windows\n    IA32 (Pentium)     Linux, FreeBSD, MacOS X, MS Windows\n    PowerPC            Linux, MacOS X\n    ARM                Linux\n\nTier 2 (maintained when possible, with help from users):\n\n    AMD64              FreeBSD, OpenBSD\n    IA32 (Pentium)     NetBSD, OpenBSD, Solaris 9\n    PowerPC            NetBSD\n    SPARC              Solaris, Linux, NetBSD\n\nOther operating systems for the processors above have not been tested,\nbut the compiler may work under other operating systems with little work.\n\nBefore the introduction of objects, OCaml was known as Caml Special\nLight. OCaml is almost upwards compatible with Caml Special Light,\nexcept for a few additional reserved keywords that have forced some\nrenaming of standard library functions.\n\nCONTENTS:\n\n  Changes               what's new with each release\n  INSTALL               instructions for installation\n  LICENSE               license and copyright notice\n  Makefile              main Makefile\n  README                this file\n  README.win32          infos on the MS Windows ports of OCaml\n  asmcomp/              native-code compiler and linker\n  asmrun/               native-code runtime library\n  boot/                 bootstrap compiler\n  bytecomp/             bytecode compiler and linker\n  byterun/              bytecode interpreter and runtime system\n  camlp4/               the Camlp4 preprocessor\n  config/               autoconfiguration stuff\n  debugger/             source-level replay debugger\n  driver/               driver code for the compilers\n  emacs/                OCaml editing mode and debugger interface for GNU Emacs\n  lex/                  lexer generator\n  maccaml/              the Macintosh GUI\n  ocamldoc/             documentation generator\n  otherlibs/            several external libraries\n  parsing/              syntax analysis\n  stdlib/               standard library\n  tools/                various utilities\n  toplevel/             interactive system\n  typing/               typechecking\n  utils/                utility libraries\n  yacc/                 parser generator\n\nCOPYRIGHT:\n\nAll files marked \"Copyright INRIA\" in this distribution are copyright\n1996, 1997, 1998, 1999, 2000, 2001, 2002, 2003, 2004, 2005, 2006,\n2007, 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012 Institut National de Recherche en\nInformatique et en Automatique (INRIA) and distributed under the\nconditions stated in file LICENSE.\n\nINSTALLATION:\n\nSee the file INSTALL for installation instructions on Unix, Linux and\nMacOS X machines.

It is an Enumerable that returns\nGit::Diff:DiffFile objects from which you can get per file patches and insertion/deletion\nstatistics.  You can also get total statistics from the Git::Diff object directly.\n\nGit::Status - returns from a @git.status command.  It is an Enumerable that returns\nGit:Status::StatusFile objects for each object in git, which includes files in the working\ndirectory, in the index and in the repository.  Similar to running 'git status' on the command\nline to determine untracked and changed files.\n\nGit::Branches - Enumerable object that holds Git::Branch objects.  You can call .local or .remote\non it to filter to just your local or remote branches.\n\nGit::Remote - A reference to a remote repository that is tracked by this repository.\n\nGit::Log - An Enumerable object that references all the Git::Object::Commit objects that encompass\nyour log query, which can be constructed through methods on the Git::Log object, like:\n\n @git.log(20).object(\"HEAD^\").since(\"2 weeks ago\").between('v2.6', 'v2.7').each { |commit| [block] } \n\n= Gitr\n\nI have included a command line pure-ruby git client called 'gitr'\n\nThe following commands are available - they all will run in pure ruby, without forking out the the git binary.\nIn fact, they can be run on a machine without git compiled on it.\n\ncommands: log\n          log-shas\n          cat-file (treeish)\n          rev-parse (treeish)\n          branches\n          config\n          ls-tree (tree)\n\n\n= Examples\n\nHere are a bunch of examples of how to use the Ruby/Git package. \n\nFirst you have to remember to require rubygems if it's not.

Both these\nmethods work like regular attribute accessors.\n\n  p = Post.find(:first)\n  p.tag_list # []\n  p.tag_list = \"Funny, Silly\"\n  p.save\n  p.tag_list # [\"Funny\", \"Silly\"]\n\nYou can also add or remove arrays of tags.\n\n  p.tag_list.add(\"Great\", \"Awful\")\n  p.tag_list.remove(\"Funny\")\n\n=== Finding tagged objects\n\nTo retrieve objects tagged with a certain tag, use find_tagged_with.\n\n  Post.find_tagged_with('Funny, Silly')\n\nBy default, find_tagged_with will find objects that have any of the given tags. To\nfind only objects that are tagged with all the given tags, use match_all.\n\n  Post.find_tagged_with('Funny, Silly', :match_all => true)\n\nSee <tt>ActiveRecord::Acts::Taggable::InstanceMethods</tt> for more methods and options.\n\n=== Tag cloud calculations\n\nTo construct tag clouds, the frequency of each tag needs to be calculated.\nBecause we specified +acts_as_taggable+ on the <tt>Post</tt> class, we can\nget a calculation of all the tag counts by using <tt>Post.tag_counts</tt>. But what if we wanted a tag count for\nan single user's posts? To achieve this we call tag_counts on the association:\n\n  User.find(:first).posts.tag_counts\n\nA helper is included to assist with generating tag clouds. Include it in your helper file:\n\n  module ApplicationHelper\n    include TagsHelper\n  end\n\nHere is an example that generates a tag cloud.\n\nController:\n\n  class PostController < ApplicationController\n    def tag_cloud\n      @tags = Post.tag_counts\n    end\n  end\n\nView:\n  <% tag_cloud @tags, %w(css1 css2 css3 css4) do |tag, css_class| %>\n    <%= link_to tag.name, { :action => :tag, :id => tag.name }, :class => css_class %>\n  <% end %>\n\nCSS:\n\n  .css1 { font-size: 1.0em; }\n  .css2 { font-size: 1.2em; }\n  .css3 { font-size: 1.4em; }\n  .css4 { font-size: 1.6em; }\n\n=== Caching\n\nIt is useful to cache the list of tags to reduce the number of queries executed. To do this,\nadd a column named <tt>cached_tag_list</tt> to the model which is being tagged. The column should be long enough to hold\nthe full tag list and must have a default value of null, not an empty string.\n\n  class CachePostTagList < ActiveRecord::Migration\n    def self.up\n      add_column :posts, :cached_tag_list, :string\n    end\n  end\n\n  class Post < ActiveRecord::Base\n    acts_as_taggable\n\n    # The caching column defaults to cached_tag_list, but can be changed:\n    # \n    # set_cached_tag_list_column_name \"my_caching_column_name\"\n  end\n\nThe details of the caching are handled for you. Just continue to use the tag_list accessor as you normally would.\nNote that the cached tag list will not be updated if you directly create Tagging objects or manually append to the\n<tt>tags</tt> or <tt>taggings</tt> associations. To update the cached tag list you should call <tt>save_cached_tag_list</tt> manually.\n\n=== Delimiter\n\nIf you want to change the delimiter used to parse and present tags, set TagList.delimiter.\nFor example, to use spaces instead of commas, add the following to config/environment.rb:\n\n  TagList.delimiter = \" \"\n\nYou can also use a regexp as delimiter:\n\n  TagList.delimiter = /,|;/\n\nThe above code would parse the string and use ',' and ';' as delimiters.\n\n=== Unused tags\n\nSet Tag.destroy_unused to remove tags when they are no longer being\nused to tag any objects. Defaults to false.\n\n  Tag.destroy_unused = true\n\n=== Other\n\nProblems, comments, and suggestions all welcome. jonathan.viney@gmail.com  \n\n",

Twitter \n\"claim no intellectual property rights over the material you provide to the \nTwitter service,\" so you should have a way of storing and repurposing your \ndata.\n\nThe original Aviary script (http://github.com/mja/aviary) was written by\nMark James Adams. It only downloaded your tweets, from your timeline. I've\nupdated it to login via OAuth, download your mentions, your direct messages,\nyour sent direct messages, and any tweets that you have replied to.\n\n== Requirements\n\nAviary+ requires the Launchy, nokogiri, and oauth gems.\n\n== Running Aviary+\n\nFirst, copy the config-example.yml to config.yml, then edit the default\npath, for archiving tweets. The default is User/Documents/aviary, which\nis probably fine for most people.\n\nIf you install your gems with rubygems, you'll need to execute Aviary+\nlike this:\n\n  $ ruby -rubygems aviary.rb\n\nIf you're using Ruby 1.9, this step won't be necessary.\n\nNext, add a Twitter account to aviary by running with\n  $ ruby aviary.rb --add accountname\n\nTo add my jmartindf account I would execute it like this\n  $ ruby aviary.rb --add jmartindf\n\nRun Aviary+ with:\n\n  $ ruby aviary.rb --updates [new|all] [--page XXX]\n\nAviary+ will create a directory called USERNAME and begin parsing your Twitter \narchive and downloading the raw XML representation of each tweet. The \n\"--updates all\" option will parse and save every tweet, while \"--updates new\" \nwill will only request tweets that are newer than the most recent one already\npresent in the USERNAME direcotry.  already been downloaded. Optionally,\nspecify a page number to retrieve tweets starting from that page. This is\nuseful when restarting the script after a timeout.\n\nUse the cat_statuses.sh script to combine all downloaded tweets for a user\ninto one statuses XML file.\n\n  $ SCREEN_NAME=username ./cat_statuses.sh > username.xml\n\nwill read in all tweets in the username directory and concatenate them \ntogether in a file called username.xml. \n\n== Creating an events timeline\n\nAssuming you have already put all of your status files into a single XML file\nusing cat_statuses.sh, you can transform it into a SIMILE timeline \n(http://simile.mit.edu/timeline/) using the assets/simili.xsl transformation \nstylesheet. View the data by modifying assets/events_template.html, replacing \n\"screenname_events.xml\" (Line 66) with the filename of your transformed \nstatuses XML document.\n\nThis can also be done automatically using the timeline.rb script:\n\n    $ ruby timeline.rb -u USERNAME\n\nwhich will read in single tweets from the USERNAME's directory and construct\nan events timeline (USERNAME_events.xml) in the timelines directory.\n\n\n== What next?\n\nNow your data is yours! Start thinking about your own way to utilize your\nown data. Start thinking about your children's children's children. Will they\nbe accessing the possibly non-existent http://twitter.com or would they\nprefer a paper record of \"what you were doing\"?\n\n",

Thus CoolOptions was born.\n\n== SYNOPSIS:\n\n=== Declaration:\n\n  options = CoolOptions.parse!(\"[options] PROJECTNAME\") do |o|\n    o.desc 'Sets up a new Rails project.'\n    o.on \"repository URL\",         \"Remote subversion repository.\"          \n    o.on \"svk\",                    \"Use svk.\",                              true\n    o.on \"project-path PATH\",      \"Root of project workspaces.\",           File.expand_path(\"~/svk\")\n    o.on \"l)repository-path PATH\", \"Remote repository path.\",               \"/\"\n    o.on \"mirror-path SVKPATH\",    \"SVK mirror path.\",                      \"//\"\n    o.on \"local-pa(t)h SVKPATH\",   \"SVK local path.\",                       \"//local\"\n    o.on \"create-structure\",       \"Create trunk/tags/branches structure.\", true\n    o.on \"finish\",                 \"Prep and commit the new project.\",      true\n\n    o.after do |r|\n      r.project_path = File.expand_path(r.project_path)\n      o.error(\"Invalid path.\") unless File.exist?(r.project_path)\n      r.project_name = ARGV.shift\n      o.error(\"Project name is required.\") unless r.project_name\n      o.error(\"Project name is too funky.\") unless /^\\w+$/ =~ r.project_name\n    end\n  end\n\n=== Usage:\n\n  $ ./new_rails_project --no-svk -r http://terralien.com/svn/terralien/ myproject\n\n=== Result:\n\n  p options.svk                 # => false\n  p options.project_path        # => '/Users/ntalbott/svk'\n  p options.repository          # => 'http://terralien.com/svn/terralien/'\n  p options.create_structure    # => true\n  p options.project_name        # => 'myproject'\n\n=== Also:\n\n  $ ./new_rails_project --help                                                               \n  Usage: t.rb [options] PROJECTNAME\n      -s, --[no-]svk                   Use svk.\n                                       Default is: true\n      -p, --project-path PATH          Root of project workspaces.\n                                       Default is: /Users/ntalbott/svk\n      -r, --repository URL             Remote subversion repository.\n      -l, --repository-path PATH       Remote repository path.\n                                       Default is: /\n      -m, --mirror-path SVKPATH        SVK mirror path.\n                                       Default is: //\n      -t, --local-path SVKPATH         SVK local path.\n                                       Default is: //local\n      -c, --[no-]create-structure      Create trunk/tags/branches structure.\n                                       Default is: true\n      -f, --[no-]finish                Prep and commit the new project.\n                                       Default is: true\n      -h, --help                       This help info.\n\n== REQUIREMENTS:\n\noptparse & ostruct (included in Ruby standard library).\n\n== DOWNLOAD:\n\nVia gems or from the\n{Rubyforge project page}[http://rubyforge.org/projects/cooloptions].\n\n== INSTALL:\n\n  sudo gem install cooloptions\n\n== CONTRIBUTE:\n\nDrop me an email (see above) and/or\n{check out the source}[http://terralien.com/svn/projects/cooloptions/trunk].\n\n== LICENSE:\n\nThe RUBY License\n\nCopyright (c) 2006 Nathaniel Talbott and Terralien, Inc.

But sometimes the person variable is actually a function call, and then we must save it in a variable first.\n\n==== old way\n  def find(*args)\n    # do some expensive database queries\n  end\n\n  person = find(:first)\n  @phone = person && person.phone   # => nil\n\n==== new way\n  @phone = find(:first).then {phone}   # => nil\n\nWe have reduced a line of code and removed a local variable.\n##else is the opposite of #then, and the two methods can be used together\n\n  'a'.then{'b'} #=> 'b'\n  nil.then{'b'}.else{'c'} #=> 'c'\n\n==== message sending\nThe normal conditional for ##then and ##else is self\n\n  if self # inside MethodChain#then\n    # evaluate block\n  end\n\n##then and ##else allow message sending as the conditional.  See more examples of message sending with the MethodChain#chain examples below\n\n  \"not empty\".then(:empty?) {\"N/A\"} # => \"not empty\"\n           \"\".then(:empty?) {\"N/A\"} # => \"N/A\"\n\n=== ##and, ##or\n==== old way\nReturn a default value or the original value depending on whether multiple conditions are met\n  Person = Struct.new(:phone )\n  blank = Person.new('') # or {:phone => nil}\n  blank.phone && (not blank.phone.empty?) ? blank.phone : \"N/A\" # => \"N/A\"\n  p = Person.new('123')\n  p.phone && (not p.phone.empty?) ? p.phone : \"N/A\" # => \"123\"\n\n==== new way\n  blank.phone.and {not empty?} || \"N/A\" # => \"N/A\"\n  p.phone.and {not empty?} || \"N/A\" # => \"123\"\n\n\n=== ##tap\nif you don't already know about this method, look it up on the net.  The tap included here allows message sending.\n\n==== old way\n  arr = [1]\n  arr.compact! # => nil\n  arr.first # => 1\n\n==== normal ##tap (still valid)\n  [1].tap {|arr| arr.compact!}.first # => 1\n\n==== new ##tap\n  [1].tap(:compact!).first # => 1\n\n==== normal ##tap (still valid)\n  [1].tap {|arr| arr.compact!}.tap {|arr| arr * 2}.first # => 1\n\n==== new ##tap\n  [1].tap( :compact!, [:*, 2] ).first # => 1\n\nYou can also pass Procs as arguments\n  [1].tap( :compact!, lambda{|arr| arr * 2} ).first # => 1\n\n\n=== ##chain\nchain is like tap, but instead of always returning self, it will return the result of the method call.\n  [1].chain(:first) == [1].first\n\nBut there is an important difference- chain guards against certain results (by default it guards against nil and false)\n\n==== old way\n  customer = nil\n  customer && customer.order && customer.order.id\n\n==== new way\n  customer.chain(:order, :id)\n\nnote that this is equivalent to\n\n  customer.then {order}.then {id}\n\n=== ##chain - Custom guards, multiple arguments, and Procs\n==== old way - guarding against zero\n  value = 0\n\n  result = if value == 0 then value else\n    tmp = value.abs\n\n    if tmp == 0 then tmp else\n      tmp * 20\n    end\n  end\n  result # => 0\n\n==== new way\n  value.chain(:abs, [:*, 20]) {|s| s == 0 }   # => 0\n\nProcs can be used, so this is equivalent to\n  value.chain(:abs, lambda {|n| n * 20 }) {|s| s == 0 } # => 0\n\n== Usage\n  require 'rubygems'\n\n=== import all MethodChain methods into Object\n\n  require 'methodchain'\n\n=== selectively import MethodChain methods\n\n  require 'methodchain/not-included'\n\nYou can then include methodchain into selected classes, or you can use the module-import gem to include only certain methods\n\n  gem install module-import\n\n  require 'module-import'\n  class Object\n    import MethodChain, :chain  # I only want Object#chain\n  end\n\nimport will still load all the private methods from the module:\n- yield_or_eval\n- send_as_function\n- send_as_functions\n\n\n== Implementation\nThere are no proxy objects and no use of method_missing- these are simply function calls, so it should be fast.\n\nprivate methods:\n* yield_or_eval: allows the two different block forms {|p| p.name} and {name}, where the first form yields self and the second form is called using instance_eval.\n* send_as_function: allows symbols and arrays to be sent as messages, and calls yield_or_eval on Proc arguments\n* send_as_functions:\n\n  def send_arguments_as_functions *args\n    args.each {|arg| send_as_function arg}\n    self\n  end\n\n== Install\ngem install methodchain\n\n== Source\n=== browser\nhttp://github.com/gregwebs/methodchain/tree/master\n=== repository\ngit clone git://github.com/gregwebs/methodchain.git\n\n== Homepage\nhttp://gregweber.info/projects/methodchain.html\n\n== RDoc documentation\nincluded with gem\n\n",

    "Readme": "= Deprecated -- Use Dataset\n\nScenarios has been replaced by Dataset, a complete rewrite, test driven. It has a number of bugs fixed and more features. Check out http://github.com/aiwilliams/dataset. I hope you find it far more useful and worth helping to extend.\n\n== Rails Scenarios Plugin\n\nWho hasn't experienced the pain of dozens of YAML files filled with hundreds\nof inter-related data structures? When do you look at People of an\nOrganization and not have to look at the organization_id, open the\norganizations.yml file, and search for 'id: X'?\n\nIn a nutshell, scenarios are a drop in replacement for YAML fixtures. Instead\nof encouraging you to create a mindless amount of raw data in the form of\nYAML, scenarios encourage you to create code that populates your tables with\nthe appropriate records.\n\nHow is it different from other solutions? A few things:\n\n * It continues to provide a fundamental, fast insertion method using attributes\n   written directly to a table. This is the\n   Scenarios::TableMethods#create_record method.\n\n * It allows you to create records using validations if you prefer, or if it's\n   important to have all your callbacks be invoked. See\n   Scenarios::TableMethods#create_model. Both create_record and create_model\n   allow you to name your instances for retrieval by the instance and id reader\n   methods (more below).\n\n * Nothing stops you from simply invoking YouModel.create!, etc. We'll still\n   keep track of the tables the scenario modifies and clean things up afterward.\n\n * It allows you to create re-usable scenarios as classes. These classes are\n   like any other class - they may include modules, subclass, and be composed of\n   other scenarios. See Scenarios::Base.uses. This also means that you can load\n   any scenario into any Rails environment. That's what the 'rake\n   db:scenario:load' task is good for (more below). Very handy for re-using all\n   that test support code to create populated demos!\n\n=== Quick Start\n\nSince Scenarios is a Rails plugin at this time, you should get it installed,\nusing the appropriate method (script/plugin, svn, piston) into your\nvendor/plugins directory. Once you have this, in your spec_helper.rb or\ntest_helper.rb, add the following line after the spec requires:\n\n  require 'scenarios'\n\nThe Scenarios you write should be placed in the spec/scenarios directory of your\nRails project if you're using RSpec, or the test/scenarios directory of your\nRails project if you're using Test::Unit. Scenario file names always end in\n\"_scenario.rb\" and classes end in \"Scenario\".\n\nA simple scenario looks like this:\n\n  # in spec/scenarios/users_scenario.rb or test/scenarios/users_scenario.rb\n  class UsersScenario < Scenario::Base\n    def load\n      create_record :user, :john, :name => 'John', :password => 'doodaht'\n      create_record :user, :cindy, :name => 'Cindy', :password => 'whoot!'\n    end\n  end\n\nIn the example above, I'm using the <tt>create_record</tt> instance method to\ncreate two users: John and Cindy. Notice the calls to <tt>create_record</tt>.\nThere are three parameters. The first is the singular name of the table to\ninsert the record into, the second is the symbolic name of the record (more on\nthat later), and the third is a hash of the attributes of the record.\n\nTo use the UsersScenario in a description, you should declare it using\nthe <tt>scenario</tt> method.  Here it is within a spec file (RSpec):\n\n  # in spec/models/user_spec.rb\n  describe User do\n    scenario :users\n\n    it \"should allow me to do something with John\" do\n      user = users(:john)\n      user.password.should == \"doodaht\"\n    end\n  end\n\nand here it is within a standard Test::Unit test:\n\n  # in test/unit/user_test.rb\n  class UserTest < Test::Unit::TestCase\n\n    scenario :users\n\n    def test_do_something\n      user = users(:john)\n      assert_equal \"doodaht\", user.password\n    end\n  end\n\nNotice that it is easy to load an instance of a model object using its\nsymbolic name with a reader method, similar to that of Rails' fixtures. In the\nexample above, I loaded John with the reader method <tt>users</tt> and the\nsymbolic name <tt>:john</tt>. (Remember that in the Users scenario I declared\nthat John should be accessible through the symbolic name <tt>:john</tt>.)\n\nI could also have retrieved an array of user fixtures by passing in\nmultiple symbolic names to the reader method:\n\n  # in spec/models/user_spec.rb\n  describe User do\n    scenario :users\n\n    it \"should allow me to get all admins\" do\n      admins = users(:john, :ryan)\n      User.admins.should eql(admins)\n    end\n  end\n\n=== Composition\n\nIn real life your scenarios will probably grow quite complicated. The\nscenarios plugin allows you to deal with this complexity through composition.\n\nHere's a simple example:\n\n  # in spec/scenarios/posts_scenario.rb or test/scenarios/posts_scenario.rb\n  class PostsScenario < Scenario::Base\n    def load\n      create_record :post, :first, :title => \"First Post\"\n      create_record :post, :second, :title => \"Second Post\"\n    end\n  end\n\n  # in spec/scenarios/comments_scenario.rb or test/scenarios/comments_scenario.rb\n  class CommentsScenario < Scenario::Base\n    uses :posts\n\n    def load\n      create_record :comment, :first, :body => \"Nice post!\", :post_id => post_id(:first)\n      create_record :comment, :second, :body => \"I like it.\", :post_id => post_id(:first)\n      create_record :comment, :third, :body => \"I thoroughly disagree.\", :post_id => post_id(:second)\n    end\n  end\n\nIn the example above, the CommentsScenario declares that it depends on the\nPosts scenario with the <tt>uses</tt> class method. This means that if you\nload the CommentsScenario, the PostsScenario will be loaded first and the\nCommentsScenario will have access to all the data loaded by the PostsScenario\nin its own <tt>load</tt> method. Note that inside the load method I'm using\nanother form of reader methed which simply gives you the id for a symbolic\nname (in this case: <tt>post_id</tt>). This is most useful for making\nassociations, as done here with comments and posts.\n\n=== Helper Methods\n\nAnother way of simplifying your scenarios and specs/tests is through helper\nmethods. The Scenarios plugin provides a handy way to declare helper methods\nthat are accessible from inside the scenario and also from inside related\nRSpec/Test::Unit examples:\n\n  # in spec/scenarios/users_scenario.rb or test/scenarios/users_scenario.rb\n  class UsersScenario < Scenario::Base\n    def load\n      create_user :name => \"John\"\n    end\n\n    helpers do\n      def create_user(attributes={})\n        create_record :user, attributes[:name].downcase.intern, attributes\n      end\n      def login_as(user)\n        @request.session[:user_id] = user.id\n      end\n    end\n  end\n\nHelper methods declared inside the helpers block are mixed into the scenario\nwhen it is instantiated and mixed into examples that declare that they are using\nthe scenario. Also, in the case where one scenario <tt>uses</tt> another, the\nusing scenario will have the helper methods of the used scenario.\n\n  # in spec/controllers/projects_controller_spec.rb\n  describe \"Projects screen\" do\n    scenario :users\n\n    it \"should show active projects\" do\n      login_as(users(:john))\n      get :projects\n      @response.should have_tag('#active_projects')\n    end\n  end\n\n  # in test/functional/projects_controller_test.rb\n  class PeopleControllerTest < Test::Unit::TestCase\n    scenario :users\n\n    def test_index\n      login_as(users(:john))\n      get :projects\n      assert_tag('#active_projects')\n    end\n  end\n\nNotice that within my specs/tests I have access to the login_as helper method\ndeclared inside the <tt>helpers</tt> block of the UsersScenario. Scenario\nhelpers are a great way to share helper methods between specs/tests that use a\nspecific scenario.\n\n=== Built-in Scenario\n\nThere is a scenario named 'blank' that comes with the plugin. This scenario is\nuseful when you want to express, and guarantee, that the database is empty. It\nworks by using your db/schema.rb, so if the table isn't created in there, it\nwon't be cleaned up.\n\nScenario.load_paths is an array of the locations to look for scenario\ndefinitions. The built-in scenarios directory is consulted last, so if you'd\nlike to re-define, for instance, the 'blank' scenario, simply create\n'blank_scenario.rb' in your spec/scenarios or test/scenarios directory.\n\n=== Load Rake Task\n\nThe Scenarios plugin provides a single Rake task, <tt>db:scenario:load</tt>,\nwhich you may use in a fashion similar to Rails fixtures'\n<tt>db:fixtures:load</tt>.\n\n  rake db:scenario:load SCENARIO=comments\n\nWhen invoked, this task will populate the development database with the named\nscenario.\n\nIf you do not specify SCENARIO, the task will expect to find a default scenario\n(a file 'default_scenario.rb' having DefaultScenario defined in it). It is our\npractice to have it such that this scenario <tt>uses</tt> a number of our other\nscenarios, thereby:\n\n* encouraging us to use test data that looks good in the running development\n  application\n\n* allowing us to troubleshoot failing tests in the running development\n  application\n\n=== More Information\n\nFor more information, be sure to look through the documentation over at RubyForge:\n\n* http://faithfulcode.rubyforge.org/docs/scenarios\n\nYou might also enjoy taking a look at the specs for the plugin and the example\nscenarios:\n\n* http://faithfulcode.rubyforge.org/svn/plugins/trunk/scenarios/spec/scenarios_spec.rb\n* http://faithfulcode.rubyforge.org/svn/plugins/trunk/scenarios/spec/scenarios\n\nBrowse the complete source code:\n\n* http://faithfulcode.rubyforge.org/svn/plugins/trunk/scenarios\n\n=== Running Tests\n\nYou should be able to simply run rake. Notice in testing/environment.rb the\nrevisions under which this project will work. If you intend to test against\nHEAD, you will need to delete the directory testing/tmp/trunk/HEAD. At some\npoint, it would be nice to have the script track the revision of HEAD that we\nhave, and update the directory automatically.\n\n=== License\n\nThe Scenarios plugin is released under the MIT-License and is Copyright (c)\n2007, Adam Williams and John W. Long. Special thanks to Chris Redinger for his\npart in helping us get this plugin ready for the public.\n",

This can get hard to manage!\n\nThe goal of plugit is to make it easy to construct library environments within which you can\nrun tests, to show that your code works in more than just one environment. It also allows you\nto keep from having copies of those libraries checked into your own repository. If they are\navailable for others to download, and you expect that they will, then you should have no problem\ndepending on them being available to you for future download, either!\n\nThis may all only prove useful to Rails plugin developers ;)\n\n== FEATURES/PROBLEMS:\n\n* FIX (list of features or problems)\n\n== SYNOPSIS:\n\nPlugit.describe do |mything|\n  mything.environment :default, 'The one we want everyone using' do |env|\n    env.library :example, '1.0', \"cp -R #{File.dirname(__FILE__)}/../../../repositories/example/*\"\n    env.library :another, '2.0', \"svn co http://something.com/svn/ALibrary\"\n  end\nend\n\nThe :default environment is loaded unless you specify otherwise through ENV['PLUGIT_ENV'].

(cd tamarind; rake local_deploy)\n\n==Adding New Ontologies\n\nTo add an ontology, a developer need only follow these steps:\n\n1.  Under tamarind/branches, create a directory for the ontology along with a module that identifies the data fields\n    necessary for filling in the ontology.  (See the FOAF ontology as an example.)\n2.  Write the template using Ruby builder syntax and save it under the directory from step 1.  Fields that must come from \n    the database should be prefixed by the \"@\" sign.  (Again, see the FOAF ontology as an example.)\n3.  There is no step three.\n\n==General Process for Using Ontologies In Your Application\n\nTo use an ontology, a developer need only follow these steps:\n\n1.  Require the gem in your application\n2.  Check out the documentation for the gem to find what ontologies are supported and learn how to use the \"offers_*\" \n    methods.\n3.  In your model file, call offers_<ontology>, where <ontology> is the lowercase RDF type (e.g. offers_foaf).\n\n====Instructions for Merb (0.9.1 or greater)\n\n*in config/init.rb\n\nMerb::BootLoader.before_app_loads do\n dependency 'tamarind'\nend\n\nMerb::BootLoader.after_app_loads do\n  Merb.add_mime_type(:rdf,:to_rdf,%w[application/rdf+xml])\nend\n\n*in any controller that's going to use Tamarind, add:\n\nprovides :rdf\n\n*in the model (e.g. User), add:\n    offers_foaf :name => 'username', \n                :email => 'email',  #takes a hash mapping the ontology's canonical attributes to the model's accessors\n                            #defaults to using the same names\n\n*in any view (e.g. the User show action) using Tamarind, add this to enable auto-discovery:\n<link rel=\"meta\" type=\"application/rdf+xml\" title=\"foo\" href=\"<%=@user.id%>.rdf\" />\n\n==TODO\n\n    Add generator for new ontologies\n    Add specs\n    Support templating engines besides Builder\n    Automatically parse the variables out of the template rather than require them to be explicitly declared\n    Improve the documentation\n    Firm up support for hashes that bind model attributes to ontology attributes\n\n",

This makes it easy to work on many separate projects without getting lost\nin all the buffers.\nEach perspective is composed of a window configuration and a set of buffers.\nSwitching to a perspective activates its window configuration, and when in a\nperspective only its buffers are available by default.\nIt's recommended that you install perspective.el from Marmalade using M-x\npackage-install. Alternately, you may put it in your load path and run\n(require 'perspective).  Users of Debian 9 or later or Ubuntu 16.04\nor later may simply apt-get install elpa-perspective.\nUsage\nTo activate perspective use (persp-mode).\nCommands are all prefixed by C-x x.

    "Readme": "= godo\n\n* version: 1.0.8\n* released: 2008-05-28\n* http://simplyruby.rubyforge.org/godo\n\n== DESCRIPTION:\n\ngo (to project) do (stuffs)\n\ngodo provides a smart way of opening a project folder in multiple terminal tabs and, in each tab,\ninvoking a commands appropriate to that project. For example if the folder contains a Rails project\nthe actions might include: starting mongrel, tailing one or more logs, starting consoles or IRB\nsessions, tailing production logs, opening an editor, running autospec, or gitk.\n\ngodo works by searching your project paths for a given search string and trying to match it against\npaths found in one or more configured project roots. It will make some straightforward efforts to\ndisambiguate among multiple matches to find the one you want.\n\ngodo then uses configurable heuristics to figure out what type of project it is, for example \"a RoR\nproject using RSpec and Subversion\". From that it will invokes a series of action appropriate to the type of project detected with each action being run, from the project folder, in its own terminal session.\n\ngodo is entirely configured by a YAML file (~/.godo) that contains project types, heuristics, actions, project paths, and a session controller. A sample configuration file is provided that can be installed using godo --install.\n\ngodo comes with an iTerm session controller for MacOSX that uses the rb-appscript gem to control iTerm (see lib/session.rb and lib/sessions/iterm_session.rb). It should be relatively straightforward to add new controller (e.g. for Leopard Terminal.app), or a controller that works in a different way (e.g. by creating new windows instead of new tabs). There is nothing MacOSX specific about the rest of godo so creating controllers for other unixen should be straightforward if they can be controlled from ruby.\n\ngodo is a rewrite of my original 'gp' script (http://matt.blogs.it/entries/00002674.html) which fixes a number of the deficiencies of that script, turns it into a gem, has a better name, and steals the idea of using heuristics to detect project types from Solomon White's gp variant (http://onrails.org/articles/2007/11/28/scripting-the-leopard-terminal).\n\ngodo now includes contributions from Lee Marlow <lee.marlow@gmail.com> including support for project level .godo files to override the global configuration, support for Terminal.app, and maximum depth support to speed up the finder.\n\ngodo lives at the excellent GitHub: http://github.com/mmower/godo/ and accepts patches and forks.\n\n== FEATURES/PROBLEMS:\n\n* All-in-one configuration file\n* Flexible heuristics for detecting project type\n* Flexible actions for running commands\n* Project level customizations\n\n== SYNOPSIS:\n\nTo install the default configuration (will not overwrite an existing configuration file)\n\ngodo --install\n\nTo open a project with it's actions\n\ngodo <project>\n\nWhere project is a search term that will match part of the project path name.\n\nIf the project has a .godo file at its root, then those actions will be used\ninstead of using the heuristics.  A project level .godo file can reference\nactions defined in ~/.godo, a group of actions by project type, and\narbitrary commands.\n\nHere's a sample project level .godo file:\n---\nactions:\n  - terminal\n  - command: echo 'tab before matcher'\n    label: This tab goes before the project matcher\n  - matcher: rails+git\n  - command: echo 'tab after matcher'\n  - terminal\n\nTo open a project and override the project type (i.e. do not use heuristics nor\na project level .godo file):\n\ngodo -o <matcher> <project>\n\nTo see what project types are available:\n\ngodo --list-types\n\n== REQUIREMENTS:\n\n* Trollop\n* rb-appscript\n\n== INSTALL:\n\n* sudo gem install godo\n* godo --install\n* mate|vi|emacs ~/.godo\n\n== LICENSE:\n\n(The MIT License)\n\nCopyright (c) 2008 Matt Mower <self@mattmower.com>\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining\na copy of this software and associated documentation files (the\n'Software'), to deal in the Software without restriction, including\nwithout limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish,\ndistribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to\npermit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to\nthe following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be\nincluded in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED 'AS IS', WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,\nEXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF\nMERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.\nIN NO EVENT SHALL THE AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY\nCLAIM, DAMAGES OR OTHER LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT,\nTORT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM, OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE\nSOFTWARE OR THE USE OR OTHER DEALINGS IN THE SOFTWARE.\n\n",

I use the .dev extension for the local domains, but you can use whatever you like. Though be careful not to define a domain which is a real domain. For example defining\n\n127.0.0.1 www.google.com\n\nwould send any request from the browser for \"www.google.com\" to your own machine, not to the real Google. That's why I use a .dev extension, which is not a real one. So, back to what you define into your hosts file. Let's use the macbook.dev main domain, with subdomains john.macbook.dev (for the user john) and chris.macbook.dev (for the user chris). The following lines should be added into your hosts file:\n\n127.0.0.1       macbook.dev\n127.0.0.1       john.macbook.dev\n127.0.0.1       chris.macbook.dev\n\nIf you want to test more subdomains for more users, you should add a line here for each one. \nNow, you should be able to go to \"macbook.dev:3000\" in your browser, and log in as chris (or john) and you'll be redirected to the correct subdomain.\n\nSupport\n========\n\nIf you need help with customizing it, or if you want to contribute to this project, drop me a line at sergiutruta[at]gmail[dot]com. \n",

    "Readme": "Polyglot\n=========\n====\nThis plugin offers the simple function of localizing your custom messages inside a Rails application. \nIn order to support multiple languages, you'll need a yml file for each language.\n\nThe Polyglot plugin offers you several functions for localization. They are available in your Models, Views, Controllers and Tests. The functions are:\n\n_(key, lang)        - returns the message in the required language\navailable_languages - tells you what are the supported languages \ncurrent_language    - tells you what is set as the current language\ncurrent_language=   - to change the default language\n\nHow to use\n==========\n==========\nAdd your own language files\n===========================\nIn the plugin root directory, you can see a languages folder. Inside this folder, you'll have to add your own language files in yml format. they contain simple key-value pairs, like this:\n\nmessage_to_display: Hello!\ngreeting: How are you today?\n\nFor English, use an 'en.yml' file, for French 'fr.en', for German 'de.yml', for Romanian 'ro.yml', and so on.\n\nRight now there are two sample files with a few messages, en.yml and ro.yml. You can change/remove these files according to your needs.\n\nThat's it. Now you can start using it.\n\nExample of usage\n=================\n=================\nHow to translate the messages\n==============================\n_('message_key', 'en') returns the message in English corresponding to this key\n_('message_key', 'ro') returns the message in Romanian corresponding to this key\n\nYou can call the \"_()\" method with a string or with a variable. And if you're using the default language, you don't have to specify the language anymore, just the message_key, like this:\n\n_ 'message_key' \nor\n_ @message_key\n\nand it will return the localized version.\n\nUsing parameters and placeholders inside the strings\n=====================================================\n\nAs the order of words differs in different languages, you can use placeholders inside your localized strings. For example:\n\n1. Fill the dictionaries\n-------------------------\n\ninside en.yml\ngreetings: Hi {0}! how are you and your friend {1} today?\n\ninside es.yml\ngreetings: Hola {0} e {1}! Comos estan ustedes hoy?\n\n2. Call the localization function\n----------------------------------\n\n_('greetings', 'Sergiu', 'George')\n\n3. The output will be:\n-----------------------\n\n\"Hi Sergiu! how are you and your friend George today?\" for english, and\n\"Hola Sergiu e George! Comos estan ustedes hoy?\" for spanish. \n\nI couldn't think of a better example right now :))\n\nHow to change the default language\n===================================\nIn order to change the default language, from example from a controller, all you have to do is this:\n\nself.default_language = 'en' or some other language.\n\nIf you forget the self, then it will be just a local variable declaration, and it will not change the default language. SO DON'T FORGET IT :).\n\nFor more technical explanation, see the comments inside polyglot.rb\n\nOther localization plugins\n===========================\n===========================\n\nCopyright (c) 2008 Sergiu Truta (http://www.sergiutruta.com), released under the MIT license.\n\n",

    "Readme": "Screw.Unit is a Behavior-Driven Testing Framework for Javascript. It features nested describes. Its goals are to provide:\n\na DSL for elegant, readable, organized specs;\nan interactive runner that can execute focused specs and describes; \nand brief, extensible source-code.\n\nWhat it is\n\nThe testing language is closure-based. Consider,\ndescribe(\"Matchers\", function() {\n  it(\"invokes the provided matcher on a call to expect\", function() {\n    expect(true).to(equal, true);\n    expect(true).to_not(equal, false);\n  });\n});\n\nA key feature of Screw.Unit are nested describes and the cascading before (and after) behavior that entails:\ndescribe(\"a nested describe\", function() {\n  var invocations = [];\n\n  before(function() {\n    invocations.push(\"before\");\n  });\n\n  describe(\"a doubly nested describe\", function() {\n    before(function() {\n      invocations.push('inner before');\n    });\n\n    it(\"runs befores in all ancestors prior to an it\", function() {\n      expect(invocations).to(equal, [\"before\", \"inner before\"]);\n    });\n  });\n});\n\nThe Runner\nThe Screw.Unit runner is pretty fancy, supporting focused describes and focused its:\n\nClick on a describe or it to run just those tests.\nGlobal Befores and Afters\nA global before is a before block run before all tests in a test suite, regardless of their nesting. This is often useful to reset global variables, or blank-out DOM nodes before each test is run. Put this at the top of the your suite file or in your spec helper.\nScrew.Unit(function(c) { with(c) {\n  before(function() { ... });\n}});\n\nNote that you can have any number of Screw.Unit(...) blocks in one file. Thus, you can have multiple global befores and afters.\nCustom Matchers\nA custom matcher is a custom assertion specifically tailored to your application. These are helpful in increasing the readability and declarativity of your tests. To create a custom matcher, fill in the blanks for this code:\nScrew.Matchers[\"be_even\"] = {\n  match: function(expected, actual) {\n    return actual % 2 == 0;\n  },\n  failure_message: function(expected, actual, not) {\n    return 'expected ' + $.print(actual) + (not ? ' not' : '') + ' to be even';\n  }\n}\n\nYou can invoke this matcher as follows: expect(2).to(be_even).\nThe Anatomy of Test Infrastructure\nTypical test infrastructure spans multiple files:\n\nA suite.html file that has the necessary html, script tags, and link tags, to include your source code as well as the test infrastructure.\nA spec_helper.js file with global before and after blocks.\nA set of custom matchers.\nYour individual tests.\n\nThe file structure will typically look like:\nspec/\n  suite.html\n  spec_helper.js\n  matchers/\n    a_matcher.js\n    another_matcher.js\n  models/\n    a_spec.js\n    another_spec.js\n  views/\n    yet_another_spec.js\n\nThe models and views directories are here only for comparison. As a general rule, mirror the file structure of your source code in your spec directory. For example, if you have an MVC application and you organize your source code into models, views, and controllers directories, have parallel directories in your spec/ directory, with tests for your models, views, and controllers in their respective directories.\nWriting Good Tests\nA great test maximizes these features:\n\nit provides documentation, explaining the intended functioning of the system as well as how the source code works;\nit supports ongoing development, as you bit-by-bit write a failing test and make it pass;\nit supports later refactoring and prevents regression as you add other features;\nand it requires little modification as the implementation of the system changes, especially changes to unrelated code.\n\nThis section focuses principally on tests as documentation. To provide documentation, as well as support future modification, a test should be readable and well organized. Here are some recommendations on how to do just that.\nUse Nested Describes to Express Context\nOften, when you test a system (a function, an object), it behaves differently in different contexts. Use nested describes liberally to express the context under which you make an assertion.\ndescribe(\"Caller#prioritize\", function() {\n  describe(\"when there are two callers in the queue\", function() {\n    describe(\"and one caller has been waiting longer than another\", function() {\n      ...\n    });\n  });\n});\n\nIn addition to using nested describes to express context, use them to organize tests by the structural properties of your source code and programming language. In Javascript this is typically prototype and function. A parent describe for a prototype contains nested describes for each of its methods. If you have cross-cutting concerns (e.g., related behavior that spans across methods or prototypes), use a describe to group them conceptually.\ndescribe(\"Car\", function() {\n  describe(\"#start\", function() {\n  });\n\n  describe(\"#stop\", function() {\n  });\n\n  describe(\"callbacks\", function() {\n    describe(\"after_purchase\", function() {\n    });\n  });\n\n  describe(\"logging\", function() {\n  });\n});\n\nIn this example, one parent describe is used for all Car behavior. There is a describe for each method. Finally, cross-cutting concerns like callbacks and logging are grouped because of their conceptual affinity.\nTest Size\nIndividual tests should be short and sweet. It is sometimes recommended to make only one assertion per test:\nit(\"chooses the caller who has been waiting the longest\", function() {\n  expect(Caller.prioritize()).to(equal, caller_waiting_the_longest);\n});\n\nAccording to some, the ideal test is one line of code. In practice, it may be excessive to divide your tests to be this small. At ten lines of code (or more), a test is difficult to read quickly. Be pragmatic, bearing in mind the aims of testing.\nAlthough one assertion per test is a good rule of thumb, feel free to violate the rule if equal clarity and better terseness is achievable:\nit(\"returns the string representation of the boolean\", function() {\n  expect($.print(true)).to(equal, 'true');\n  expect($.print(false)).to(equal, 'false');\n});\n\nTwo tests would be overkill in this example.\nVariable Naming\nName variables descriptively, especially ones that will become expected values in assertions. caller_waiting_the_longest is better than c1.\nDividing code between tests and befores\nIf there is only one line of setup and it is used in only one test, it may be better to include the setup in the test itself:\nit(\"decrements the man's luck by 5\", function() {\n  var man = new Man({luck: 5});\n\n  cat.cross_path(man);\n  expect(man.luck()).to(equal, 0);\n});\n\nBut in general, it's nice to keep setup code in before blocks, especially if the setup can be shared across tests.\ndescribe('Man', function() {\n  var man;\n  before(function() {\n    man = new Man({luck: 5});\n  });\n\n  describe('#decrement_luck', function() {\n    it(\"decrements the luck field by the given amount\", function() {\n      man.decrement_luck(3);\n      expect(man.luck()).to(equal, 2)\n    });\n  });\n  ...\n});\n\nPreconditions\nIt is ideal, if there is any chance that your preconditions are non-obvious, to make precondition asserts in your test. The last example, were it more complicated, might be better written:\nit(\"decrements the luck field by the given amount\", function() {\n  expect(man.luck()).to(equal, 5);\n\n  man.decrement_luck(3);\n  expect(man.luck()).to(equal, 2)\n});\n\nWhitespace, as seen here, can be helpful in distinguishing setup and preconditions from the system under test (SUT) and its assertions. It is nice to be consistent in your use of whitespace (e.g., \"always follow a group of preconditions by a newline\"). But it is better to use whitespace as makes the most sense given the context. As with everything in life, do it consciously and deliberately, but change your mind frequently.\nBehavioral Testing\nBehavioral testing, that is, asserting that certain functions are called rather than certain values returned, is best done with closures. The dynamic nature of JavaScript makes mocking frameworks mostly unnecessary.\nit(\"invokes #decrement_luck\", function() {\n  var decrement_luck_was_called = false;\n  man.decrement_luck = function(amount) {\n    decrement_luck_was_called = true;\n  });\n\n  cat.cross_path(man);\n  expect(decrement_luck_was_called).to(equal, true);\n});\n\nHow to Test the DOM\nThe simplest way to test the DOM is to have a special DOM node in your suite.html file. Have all tests insert nodes into this node; have a global before reset the node between tests.\nIn suite.html:\n<div id=\"dom_test\"></div>\n\nIn spec_helper.js:\nScrew.Unit(function() {\n  before(function() {\n    document.getElementById('dom_test').innerHTML = ''; // but use your favorite JS library here.\n  });\n});\n\nIn some_spec.js:\ndescribe(\"something that manipulates the DOM\", function() {\n  it(\"is effortless to test!\", function() {\n    var dom_test = document.getElementById('dom_test');\n    dom_test.innerHTML = 'awesome';\n    expect(dom_test.innerHTML).to(equal, 'awesome');\n  });\n});\n\nA Javascript library like jQuery, Prototype, or YUI is a essential for testing events.\nImplementation Details\nScrew.Unit is implemented using some fancy metaprogramming learned from the formidable Yehuda Katz. This allows the describe and it functions to not pollute the global namespace. Essentially, we take the source code of your test and wrap it in a with block which provides a new scope:\nvar contents = fn.toString().match(/^[^\\{]*{((.*\\n*)*)}/m)[1];\nvar fn = new Function(\"matchers\", \"specifications\",\n  \"with (specifications) { with (matchers) { \" + contents + \" } }\"\n);\n\nfn.call(this, Screw.Matchers, Screw.Specifications);\n\nFurthermore, Screw.Unit is implemented using the Concrete Javascript style, which is made possible by the Effen plugin and jQuery. Concrete Javascript is an alternative to MVC. In Concrete Javascript, DOM objects serve as the model and view simultaneously. The DOM is constructed using semantic (and visual) markup, and behaviors are attached directly to DOM elements. For example,\n$('.describe').fn({\n  parent: function() {\n    return $(this).parent('.describes').parent('.describe');\n  },\n  run: function() {\n    $(this).children('.its').children('.it').fn('run');\n    $(this).children('.describes').children('.describe').fn('run');\n  },\n});\n\nHere two methods (#parent and #run) are attached directly to DOM elements that have class describe. To invoke one of these methods, simply:\n$('.describe').fn('run');\n\nBind behaviors by passing a hash (see the previous example). Using CSS3 selectors and cascading to attach behaviors provides interesting kind of multiple inheritance and polymorphism:\n$('.describe, .it').fn({...}); // applies to both describe and its\n$('.describe .describe').fn({...}); // applies to nested describes only\n\nExtensibility\nScrew.Unit is designed from the ground-up to be extensible. For example, to add custom logging, simply subscribe to certain events:\n$('.it')\n  .bind('enqueued', function() {...})\n  .bind('running', function() {...})\n  .bind('passed', function() {...})\n  .bind('failed', function(e, reason) {...})\n\nThere are also events for the loading and loaded test code code, as well as just before and just after all tests are run:\n$(Screw)\n  .bind('loading', function() {...})\n  .bind('loaded', function() {...})\n  .bind('before', function() {...})\n  .bind('after', function() {...})\n\nDownload\nYou can download the source from Github. There is are plenty of examples in the distribution.\nThanks to\n\nNathan Sobo\nYehuda Katz\nBrian Takita\nAman Gupta\nTim Connor\n\n",

For example, in order to produce\nSELECT * FROM users\n\nyou construct a table relation and convert it to sql:\nusers = Table(:users)\nusers.to_sql\n\nIn fact, you will probably never call #to_sql. Rather, you'll work with data from the table directly. You can iterate through all rows in the users table like this:\nusers.each { |user| ... }\n\nIn other words, Arel relations implement Ruby's Enumerable interface. Let's have a look at a concrete example:\nusers.first # => { users[:id] => 1, users[:name] => 'bob' }\n\nAs you can see, Arel converts the rows from the database into a hash, the values of which are sublimated to the appropriate Ruby primitive (integers, strings, and so forth).\nMore Sophisticated Queries Relations\nHere is a whirlwind tour through the most common relational operators. These will probably cover 80% of all interaction with the database.\nFirst is the 'restriction' operator, where:\nusers.where(users[:name].eq('amy'))\n# => SELECT * FROM users WHERE users.name = 'amy'\n\nWhat would, in SQL, be part of the SELECT clause is called in Arel a projection:\nusers.project(users[:id]) # => SELECT users.id FROM users\n\nJoins resemble SQL strongly:\nusers.join(photos).on(users[:id].eq(photos[:user_id]))\n# => SELECT * FROM users INNER JOIN photos ON users.id = photos.user_id\n\nWhat are called LIMIT and OFFSET in SQL are called take and skip in Arel:\nusers.take(5) # => SELECT * FROM users LIMIT 5\nusers.skip(4) # => SELECT * FROM users OFFSET 4\n\nGROUP BY is called group:\nusers.group(users[:name]) # => SELECT * FROM users GROUP BY name\n\nThe best property of the Relational Algebra is its \"composability\", or closure under all operations. For example, to select AND project, just \"chain\" the method invocations:\nusers                                 \\\n  .where(users[:name].eq('amy'))      \\\n  .project(users[:id])                \\\n# => SELECT users.id FROM users WHERE users.name = 'amy'\n\nAll operators are chainable in this way, and they are chainable any number of times, in any order.\nusers.where(users[:name].eq('bob')).where(users[:age].lt(25))\n\nOf course, many of the operators take multiple arguments, so the last example can be written more tersely:\nusers.where(users[:name].eq('bob'), users[:age].lt(25))\n\nThe OR operator is not yet supported. It will work like this:\nusers.where(users[:name].eq('bob').or(users[:age].lt(25)))\n\nThe AND operator will behave similarly.\nFinally, most operations take a block form. For example:\nTable(:users)                    \\\n  .where   { |u| u[:id].eq(1) } \\\n  .project { |u| u[:id] }\n\nThis provides a (sometimes) convenient alternative syntax.\nThe Crazy Features\nThe examples above are fairly simple and other libraries match or come close to matching the expressiveness of Arel (e.g., Sequel in Ruby).\nComplex Joins\nWhere Arel really shines in its ability to handle complex joins and aggregations. As a first example, let's consider an \"adjacency list\", a tree represented in a table. Suppose we have a table comments, representing a threaded discussion:\ncomments = Table(:comments)\n\nAnd this table has the following attributes:\ncomments.attributes # => [comments[:id], comments[:body], comments[:parent_id]]\n\nThe parent_id column is a foreign key from the comments table to itself. Now, joining a table to itself requires aliasing in SQL. In fact, you may alias in Arel as well:\nreplies = comments.alias\ncomments_with_replies = \\\n  comments.join(replies).on(replies[:parent_id].eq(comments[:id]))\n# => SELECT * FROM comments INNER JOIN comments AS comments_2 WHERE comments_2.parent_id = comments.id\n\nThe call to #alias is actually optional: Arel will always produce a unique name for every table joined in the relation, and it will always do so deterministically to exploit query caching. Explicit aliasing is more common, however. When you want to extract specific slices of data, aliased tables are a necessity. For example to get just certain columns from the row, treat a row like a hash:\ncomments_with_replies.first[replies[:body]]\n\nThis will return the first comment's reply's body.\nIf you don't need to extract the data later (for example, you're simply doing a join to find comments that have replies, you don't care what the content of the replies are), the block form may be preferable:\ncomments.join(comments) { |comments, replies| replies[:parent_id].eq(comments[:id]) }\n# => SELECT * FROM comments INNER JOIN comments AS comments_2 WHERE comments_2.parent_id = comments.id\n\nNote that you do NOT want to do something like:\ncomments.join(comments, comments[:parent_id].eq(comments[:id]))\n# => SELECT * FROM comments INNER JOIN comments AS comments_2 WHERE comments.parent_id = comments.id\n\nThis does NOT have the same meaning as the previous query, since the comments[:parent_id] reference is effectively ambiguous.\nComplex Aggregations\nMy personal favorite feature of Arel, certainly the most difficult to implement, and possibly only of marginal value, is closure under joining even in the presence of aggregations. This is a feature where the Relational Algebra is fundamentally easier to use than SQL. Think of this as a preview of the kind of radical functionality that is to come, stuff no other \"ORM\" is doing.\nThe easiest way to introduce this is in SQL. Your task is to get all users and the count of their associated photos. Let's start from the inside out:\nSELECT count(*)\nFROM photos\nGROUP BY user_id\n\nNow, we'd like to join this with the user table. Naively, you might try to do this:\nSELECT users.*, count(photos.id)\nFROM users\nLEFT OUTER JOIN photos\n  ON users.id = photos.id\nGROUP BY photos.user_id\n\nOf course, this has a slightly different meaning than our intended query. This is actually a fairly advanced topic in SQL so let's see why this doesn't work step by step. Suppose we have these records in our users table:\nmysql> select * from users;\n+------+--------+\n| id   | name   |\n+------+--------+\n|    1 | hai    | \n|    2 | bai    | \n|    3 | dumpty | \n+------+--------+\n\nAnd these in the photos table:\nmysql> select * from photos;\n+------+---------+-----------+\n| id   | user_id | camera_id |\n+------+---------+-----------+\n|    1 |       1 |         1 | \n|    2 |       1 |         1 | \n|    3 |       1 |         1 | \n+------+---------+-----------+\n\nIf we perform the above, incorrect query, we get the following:\nmysql> select users.*, count(photos.id) from users left outer join photos on users.id = photos.user_id limit 3 group by user_id;\n+------+------+------------------+\n| id   | name | count(photos.id) |\n+------+------+------------------+\n|    2 | bai  |                0 | \n|    1 | hai  |                3 | \n+------+------+------------------+\n\nAs you can see, we're completely missing data for user with id 3. dumpty has no photos, neither does bai. But strangely bai appeared and dumpty didn't! The reason is that the GROUP BY clause is aggregating on both tables, not just the photos table. All users without photos have a photos.id of null (thanks to the left outer join). These are rolled up together and an arbitrary user wins. In this case, bai not dumpty.\nSELECT users.*, photos_aggregation.cnt\nFROM users\nLEFT OUTER JOIN (SELECT user_id, count(*) as cnt FROM photos GROUP BY user_id) AS photos_aggregation\n  ON photos_aggregation.user_id = users.id\n\n",

    "Name": "socialactions-mashup-rssa-crawler-and-api",
    "Readme": "== Welcome to Rails\n\nRails is a web-application and persistence framework that includes everything\nneeded to create database-backed web-applications according to the\nModel-View-Control pattern of separation. This pattern splits the view (also\ncalled the presentation) into \"dumb\" templates that are primarily responsible\nfor inserting pre-built data in between HTML tags. The model contains the\n\"smart\" domain objects (such as Account, Product, Person, Post) that holds all\nthe business logic and knows how to persist themselves to a database. The\ncontroller handles the incoming requests (such as Save New Account, Update\nProduct, Show Post) by manipulating the model and directing data to the view.\n\nIn Rails, the model is handled by what's called an object-relational mapping\nlayer entitled Active Record. This layer allows you to present the data from\ndatabase rows as objects and embellish these data objects with business logic\nmethods. You can read more about Active Record in\nlink:files/vendor/rails/activerecord/README.html.\n\nThe controller and view are handled by the Action Pack, which handles both\nlayers by its two parts: Action View and Action Controller. These two layers\nare bundled in a single package due to their heavy interdependence. This is\nunlike the relationship between the Active Record and Action Pack that is much\nmore separate. Each of these packages can be used independently outside of\nRails.  You can read more about Action Pack in\nlink:files/vendor/rails/actionpack/README.html.\n\n\n== Getting Started\n\n1. At the command prompt, start a new Rails application using the <tt>rails</tt> command\n   and your application name. Ex: rails myapp\n   (If you've downloaded Rails in a complete tgz or zip, this step is already done)\n2. Change directory into myapp and start the web server: <tt>script/server</tt> (run with --help for options)\n3. Go to http://localhost:3000/ and get \"Welcome aboard: You\u2019re riding the Rails!\"\n4. Follow the guidelines to start developing your application\n\n\n== Web Servers\n\nBy default, Rails will try to use Mongrel and lighttpd if they are installed, otherwise\nRails will use WEBrick, the webserver that ships with Ruby. When you run script/server,\nRails will check if Mongrel exists, then lighttpd and finally fall back to WEBrick. This ensures\nthat you can always get up and running quickly.\n\nMongrel is a Ruby-based webserver with a C component (which requires compilation) that is\nsuitable for development and deployment of Rails applications. If you have Ruby Gems installed,\ngetting up and running with mongrel is as easy as: <tt>gem install mongrel</tt>.\nMore info at: http://mongrel.rubyforge.org\n\nIf Mongrel is not installed, Rails will look for lighttpd. It's considerably faster than\nMongrel and WEBrick and also suited for production use, but requires additional\ninstallation and currently only works well on OS X/Unix (Windows users are encouraged\nto start with Mongrel). We recommend version 1.4.11 and higher. You can download it from\nhttp://www.lighttpd.net.\n\nAnd finally, if neither Mongrel or lighttpd are installed, Rails will use the built-in Ruby\nweb server, WEBrick. WEBrick is a small Ruby web server suitable for development, but not\nfor production.\n\nBut of course its also possible to run Rails on any platform that supports FCGI.\nApache, LiteSpeed, IIS are just a few. For more information on FCGI,\nplease visit: http://wiki.rubyonrails.com/rails/pages/FastCGI\n\n\n== Debugging Rails\n\nSometimes your application goes wrong.  Fortunately there are a lot of tools that\nwill help you debug it and get it back on the rails.\n\nFirst area to check is the application log files.  Have \"tail -f\" commands running\non the server.log and development.log. Rails will automatically display debugging\nand runtime information to these files. Debugging info will also be shown in the\nbrowser on requests from 127.0.0.1.\n\nYou can also log your own messages directly into the log file from your code using\nthe Ruby logger class from inside your controllers. Example:\n\n  class WeblogController < ActionController::Base\n    def destroy\n      @weblog = Weblog.find(params[:id])\n      @weblog.destroy\n      logger.info(\"#{Time.now} Destroyed Weblog ID ##{@weblog.id}!\")\n    end\n  end\n\nThe result will be a message in your log file along the lines of:\n\n  Mon Oct 08 14:22:29 +1000 2007 Destroyed Weblog ID #1\n\nMore information on how to use the logger is at http://www.ruby-doc.org/core/\n\nAlso, Ruby documentation can be found at http://www.ruby-lang.org/ including:\n\n* The Learning Ruby (Pickaxe) Book: http://www.ruby-doc.org/docs/ProgrammingRuby/\n* Learn to Program: http://pine.fm/LearnToProgram/  (a beginners guide)\n\nThese two online (and free) books will bring you up to speed on the Ruby language\nand also on programming in general.\n\n\n== Debugger\n\nDebugger support is available through the debugger command when you start your Mongrel or\nWebrick server with --debugger. This means that you can break out of execution at any point\nin the code, investigate and change the model, AND then resume execution! Example:\n\n  class WeblogController < ActionController::Base\n    def index\n      @posts = Post.find(:all)\n      debugger\n    end\n  end\n\nSo the controller will accept the action, run the first line, then present you\nwith a IRB prompt in the server window. Here you can do things like:\n\n  >> @posts.inspect\n  => \"[#<Post:0x14a6be8 @attributes={\\\"title\\\"=>nil, \\\"body\\\"=>nil, \\\"id\\\"=>\\\"1\\\"}>,\n       #<Post:0x14a6620 @attributes={\\\"title\\\"=>\\\"Rails you know!\\\", \\\"body\\\"=>\\\"Only ten..\\\", \\\"id\\\"=>\\\"2\\\"}>]\"\n  >> @posts.first.title = \"hello from a debugger\"\n  => \"hello from a debugger\"\n\n...and even better is that you can examine how your runtime objects actually work:\n\n  >> f = @posts.first\n  => #<Post:0x13630c4 @attributes={\"title\"=>nil, \"body\"=>nil, \"id\"=>\"1\"}>\n  >> f.\n  Display all 152 possibilities?

All views use eRuby\n  syntax.\n\napp/views/layouts\n  Holds the template files for layouts to be used with views. This models the common\n  header/footer method of wrapping views. In your views, define a layout using the\n  <tt>layout :default</tt> and create a file named default.erb. Inside default.erb,\n  call <% yield %> to render the view using this layout.\n\napp/helpers\n  Holds view helpers that should be named like weblogs_helper.rb. These are generated\n  for you automatically when using script/generate for controllers. Helpers can be used to\n  wrap functionality for your views into methods.\n\nconfig\n  Configuration files for the Rails environment, the routing map, the database, and other dependencies.\n\ndb\n  Contains the database schema in schema.rb.  db/migrate contains all\n  the sequence of Migrations for your schema.\n\ndoc\n  This directory is where your application documentation will be stored when generated\n  using <tt>rake doc:app</tt>\n\nlib\n  Application specific libraries.

    "Readme": "\nGPS Library for Ruby\nThis library provides a Ruby interface to GPS receivers. Features include:\n\nSupport for multiple receivers. Receiver connects to a GPS and\nobtains all data in a Fix.\n\nGPSD Receiver for obtaining data from units supported by GPSD.\n\nEvent callbacks for position, speed and course change.\n\nPlugin architecture. Distribute new Receiver implementations as\ngems.\n\nThis library is part of the [Hermes](hermes-gps.info/) project.\nInstallation\nSimply install via gems with the command:\ngem install gps\nOr run the included setup.rb like so:\nruby setup.rb config ruby setup.rb install\nExample usage\nFor a working example, see the [included web service\nsample](examples/gps_service.rb).\nThere are a few simple steps to using this library, but before doing any of\nthem you must first:\nrequire \u201cgps\u201d\nCreate the Receiver\nA Receiver is created by calling +Gps::Receiver.create+ with an\nimplementation and hash of options. If no implementation is given, the\nfirst found implementation is used. In a stock installation without any\nadditional plugins, the following calls are equivalent:\ngps = Gps::Receiver.create gps = Gps::Receiver.create(\u201cgpsd\u201d) gps =\nGps::Receiver.create(:host => \u201clocalhost\u201d, :port => 2947) gps =\nGps::Receiver.create(\u201cgpsd\u201d, :host => \u201clocalhost\u201d)\nThe GPSD Receiver supports both :host and :port\noptions which point to a host on which a GPSD instance is running.\nReceiver options are not standard.\nStart the Receiver\nThe Receiver is now created, but is not yet polling the hardware.\nTo start this process, run:\ngps.start\nVerify that this has succeeded by running:\ngps.started?\nAssuming this succeeded, you can now access gps.latitude,\ngps.longitude, _gps.altitude, gps.course,\ngps.speed and other variables exposed via Fix.\nCallbacks\nYou can also register callbacks which are triggered on various GPS events\nlike so:\ngps.on_position_change { puts \u201cLatitude = #{gps.latitude}, longitude =\n#{gps.longitude}\u201d } gps.on_course_change { puts \u201cCourse = #{gps.course}\u201d }\ngps.on_speed_change { puts \u201cSpeed = #{gps.speed}\u201d }\n+Receiver#on_position_change+ supports an additional threshold.\nBecause of GPS drift, positions change often. As such, it is possible to\nspecify a threshold like so:\ngps.on_position_change(0.0002) { puts \u201cLatitude = #{gps.latitude},\nlongitude = #{gps.longitude}\u201d }\nThe callback will not trigger on position changes of less than 0.0002\ndegrees since it was last called.\nCleaning up\nTo close devices or connections and no longer receive GPS updates, call the\nfollowing method:\ngps.stop\nHacking\nThe GPSD Receiver should be sufficient for most needs. If,\nhowever, you wish to parse NMEA data directly, interface with raw serial\nports or interact with your GPS hardware on a lower level, a new\nReceiver implementation is necessary. This section is a quick\noverview to writing Receiver implementations.\nWhen overriding the below methods, super should be the last method\ncalled. Also, as polling happens in a separate thread, Receiver\ncode should be thread-safe.\nUse +Gps::Receivers+\nThe library looks up Receiver implementations in the\n+Gps::Receivers+ module. Therefore, all implementations must be defined\nthere.\nOverride +Receiver#start+\nThis method should open the device, initiate a connection, etc.\nOverride +Receiver#stop+, if Necessary\nThe default stop method simply kills the thread and sets it to\nnil. If this is sufficient, overriding is unnecessary.\nOverride +Receiver#update+\nThis method should read an update from the device, setting the variables\nexposed by Fix.\nMake it a Plugin\nIf the gem_plugin library is installed, new Receivers distributed\nas gems can be integrated automatically with a few simple steps.\n\nDistribute your Receiver as a gem that depends on both the gps and\ngem_plugin gems.\n\nAdd the following code to your plugin:\n\nGemPlugin::Manager.instance.create(\u201c/receivers/your_receiver_name\u201d,\n:optional_option => :value)\n",

It goes onto IRC and sits in a channel that you\npick for it, and learns, remembers, and gives back useful information.\n\n<dagbrown> flooterbuck, convert 3 tonnes to nautical elvis\n<flooterbuck> dagbrown: 3 tonnes is 22.5341 nautical elvis.\n<dagbrown> flooterbuck: My hair is wet\n<flooterbuck> dagbrown: Okay.\n<dagbrown> flooterbuck, what is a Norse?\n<flooterbuck> dagbrown: A Norse is a Norse, of course, of course\n\n-- Note:  Flooterbuck Infobot vs. Infobot\n\nFlooterbuck Infobot (http://flooterbuck.sf.net/) is a rewrite of\nKevin Lenzo's (apparently abandoned) Infobot (http://www.infobot.org/).\nFlooterbuck is meant to be cleaner, more modular, and more hackable than\nthe original Infobot.\n\nThe authors of Flooterbuck Infobot believe that all of the old Infobot\nfunctionality has been preserved.  However, it is still recommended that\nyou keep your old installations of Infobot around, just in case you find\nthat there is something necessary which only exists in the old Infobot\n(and in that case, please contact the authors of Flooterbuck).\n\nTheoretically, you can copy all of the .db files and the conf/*.config\nfiles from your old Infobot installations into your Flooterbuck installation\nand it will work.  However, you may not get all of the new features of\nFlooterbuck that way -- you should at least have a look at the sample\nconfiguration file included with Flooterbuck to see if there's any new\nfeatures that you want to enable.\n\nFor more information on the differences between Flooterbuck and\nInfobot, please see the REVISIONS files.\n\n\n\n-- Very minimal setup instructions\n\nYou will need to update your infobot.config\nand infobot.users.  See the example files.\n\nThis requires perl 5.\n\nYou should be able to start up just by running\ninfobot.  If you are using macperl, you will\n(currently) have to make one minor change (because\n$^O didn't work for me under os8).\n\nThe infobot uses parameter files, typically in the\nparams directory, to set up with.  It treats anything\non the command line as a parameter file and tries to\nload it.\n\nIf you are using macperl, you will want to set\nthe value of the macperl parameter to 1 in the\ntwo given param files (in the 'files' dir).\n\nBy default, the infobot uses the IRC setup.  This\nmay change.  NOTE that the irc version has no output\nby default; you'll have to turn up the debug level\nto get more.\n\nto start up the infobot, just invoke it from the\ncommand line.\n\n   infobot\n\n\n\n-- A note on forms\n\nYou can prepend the tag <reply>\nto values in the db to just get a reply with no\nextra info.\n\ne.g.\n\n   x => <reply> y\n\nthen when you ask 'x?' it will just reply 'y' instead\nof something like \"i think x is y\".\n\n\n\n\n-- Extending the bot by adding your own code\n\nYou can place your module in the modules directory.  It needs to define a\npackage with the same name as the file itself (without the .pm extension).  It\nneeds to define a subroutine named scan() that takes a callback function, a\nmessage, and the nick of the person who wrote that message.\n\nThe callback function is the function which, when called with an\nargument, will reply to the query in the appropriate way.  That is,\nif the query was originally a private message, the callback function\nwill reply via private message.  If the query was a message in a\nchannel, the callback function will send the reply to the correct\nchannel.\n\nIf the module does not \"catch\" a message, then scan() function should\nreturn undef to allow the message to \"fall through\" to other modules.\n\nThe best way to figure all this out is to look at one of the many modules\nprovided as a reference.\n\nOh, and if the module you added would be of interest to other Flooterbuck\nusers, you might want to consider contributing that code to the project.\nFlooterbuck can be found on Sourceforge at http://flooterbuck.sf.net/\n\n\n\n-- Disabling features of the bot\n\nNearly everything that Flooterbuck does (beside the actual communication\nwith the IRC server) is handled by the modules in the modules directory.\nAlthough some modules can be enabled or disabled by changing the configuration\nfiles, you can disable any module by simply deleting it or moving it to\na different directory.\n\n\n\n-- update_db & dump_db\n\nupdate_db is a little perl script that will take a\nflat ascii file and make an infobot-style db out\nof it (currently just a couple of dbm files). You'll\nwant to make 2, even if theye contain only 1 element\neach.  it will also simply add (and overwrite entries\nin) existing dbs.  This is especially nice if\nyou don't allow updates to the databases through IRC\nand just want a collection of permanent factoids.\n\nupdate_db <inputfile> <dbname>\n\nwhere <inputfile> is an ascii file like (in the case\nof an url-style infobot):\n\ninfobot => at http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~lenzo/hocus.html\n\none key => value per line.  In the current setup,\nyou need an is-database and an are-database, mainly\nfor legacy reasons about representing plurality and\nbeing able to give the proper form.  in the infobot-is.txt\nfile and infobot-are.txt files you have examples.  these\nare a fine starting point:\n\n1.1  update_db infobot-is.txt infobot-is\n     update_db infobot-are.txt infobot-are\n\n2. Now you need to edit infobot to set up your bot.\n   Don't forget to set the path to perl properly at\n   the top and make it executable.\n\n3. Then try running infobot.  At present, there's a\n   bunch of VERY BAD code in it, so don't use the -w\n   switch unless you want to fix a bunch of things and\n   mail me.\n\nEventually, kill it and then you'll probably\nwant to crontab it.  included is a sample crontab\nand the script that you will need to edit.\n\ndump_db <dbname>\n\nwill just make a flat ascii file out of the named db,\ne.g.\n\n   dump_db infobot-is\n\nBoth update_db and dump_db take an optional switch, -m, which tells them\nwhat DBM module to use.  You'll need to specify this if you set\nDBMModule in your config file in order to get the bot to use something\nother than Perl's default.  Eg,\n\n   update_db -m DB_File infobot-is.txt infobot-is\n   dump_db   -m DB_File infobot-is\n\ngood luck, and mail me!\n\nkevin\nlenzo@cs.cmu.edu\n\nps - i am just releasing this _now_ instead of waiting\n     to fix everything.  If you use this and like it,\n     or even if you don't, please mail me!\n\n\n\n-- Thanks to:\n\nKevin Lenzo and his team for the original Infobot.\n\n\n\n",

This\nhas several advantages:\n\n\nAll filesystem information is cached and is only re-read on demand\nIf you revisit a part of the tree that you left earlier in your\nsession, the directory nodes will be opened/closed as you left them\n\nThe script remembers the cursor position and window position in the NERD\ntree so you can toggle it off (or just close the tree window) and then\nreopen it (with NERDTreeToggle) the NERD tree window will appear exactly\nas you left it\nYou can have a separate NERD tree for each tab, share trees across tabs,\nor a mix of both.\nBy default the script overrides the default file browser (netrw), so if\nyou :edit a directory a (slightly modified) NERD tree will appear in the\ncurrent window\nA programmable menu system is provided (simulates right clicking on a node)\n\n\none default menu plugin is provided to perform basic filesystem\noperations (create/delete/move/copy files/directories)\n\nThere's an API for adding your own keymappings\n\nInstallation\npathogen.vim\ngit clone https://github.com/scrooloose/nerdtree.git ~/.vim/bundle/nerdtree\n\nThen reload vim, run :helptags ~/.vim/bundle/nerdtree/doc/, and check out :help NERD_tree.txt.\napt-vim\napt-vim install -y https://github.com/scrooloose/nerdtree.git\n\nFaq\n\nIs there any support for git flags?\n\nYes, install nerdtree-git-plugin.\n\n\nCan I have the nerdtree on every tab automatically?\n\nNope.

It\nwas originally developed by Sean Schofield and is now maintained by developers from Spark Solutions and Vinsol. We're open to contributions and accepting new Core Team members.\nSpree consists of several different gems, each of which are maintained\nin a single repository and documented in a single set of\nonline documentation.\n\nspree_api (RESTful API)\nspree_frontend (Customer frontend)\nspree_backend (Admin panel)\nspree_cmd (Command-line tools)\nspree_core (Models & Mailers, the basic components of Spree that it can't run without)\nspree_sample (Sample data)\n\nGetting Started\nRequired rails rails (~> 4.2.5)\nAdd Spree gems to your Gemfile:\ngem 'spree', '~> 3.1.0'\ngem 'spree_auth_devise', '~> 3.1.0'\ngem 'spree_gateway', '~> 3.1.0'\nRun bundle install\nUse the install generators to set up Spree:\nrails g spree:install --user_class=Spree::User\nrails g spree:auth:install\nrails g spree_gateway:install\nInstallation options\nAlternatively, if you want to use the bleeding edge version of Spree (for Rails 5), add this to your Gemfile:\ngem 'spree', github: 'spree/spree'\ngem 'spree_auth_devise', github: 'spree/spree_auth_devise'\ngem 'spree_gateway', github: 'spree/spree_gateway'\nNote: The master branch is not guaranteed to ever be in a fully functioning\nstate. It is unwise to use this branch in a production system you care deeply\nabout.\nBy default, the installation generator (rails g spree:install) will run\nmigrations as well as adding seed and sample data. This can be disabled using\nrails g spree:install --migrate=false --sample=false --seed=false\nYou can always perform any of these steps later by using these commands.\nbundle exec rake railties:install:migrations\nbundle exec rake db:migrate\nbundle exec rake db:seed\nbundle exec rake spree_sample:load\nBrowse Store\nhttp://localhost:3000\nBrowse Admin Interface\nhttp://localhost:3000/admin\nExtensions\nSpree Extensions provide additional features not present in the Core system.\n\n\nExtension\nDescription\n\n\n\nspree_i18n\nI18n translation files for Spree Commerce\n\n\nspree-multi-domain\nMultiple Spree stores on different domains - single unified backed for processing orders\n\n\nspree_multi_currency\nProvides UI to allow configuring multiple currencies in Spree\n\n\nspree_braintree_vzero\nOfficial Spree Braintree v.zero + PayPal extension\n\n\nspree_address_book\nAdds address book for users to Spree\n\n\nspree_digital\nA Spree extension to enable downloadable products\n\n\nspree_social\nBuilding block for spree social networking features (provides authentication and account linkage)\n\n\nspree_related_products\nRelated products extension for Spree\n\n\nspree_active_shipping\nSpree integration for Shopify's active_shipping gem\n\n\nspree_static_content\nManage static pages for Spree\n\n\nspree-product-assembly\nAdds oportunity to make bundle of products\n\n\nspree_editor\nRich text editor for Spree with Image and File uploading in-place\n\n\nspree_recently_viewed\nRecently viewed products in Spree\n\n\nspree_wishlist\nWishlist extension for Spree\n\n\nspree_sitemap\nSitemap Generator for Spree\n\n\nPerformance\nYou may notice that your Spree store runs slowly in development environment. This can be because in development each asset (css and javascript) is loaded separately. You can disable it by adding the following line to config/environments/development.rb.\nconfig.assets.debug = false\nDeveloping Spree\nSpree is meant to be run within the context of Rails application and the source code is essentially a collection of gems. You can easily create a sandbox\napplication inside of your cloned source directory for testing purposes.\nClone the Git repo\ngit clone git://github.com/spree/spree.git\ncd spree\nInstall the gem dependencies\nbundle install\nSandbox\nCreate a sandbox Rails application for testing purposes which automatically perform all necessary database setup\nbundle exec rake sandbox\nStart the server\ncd sandbox\nrails server\nRunning Tests\nWe use CircleCI to run the tests for Spree.\nYou can see the build statuses at https://circleci.com/gh/spree/spree.\n\nEach gem contains its own series of tests, and for each directory, you need to\ndo a quick one-time creation of a test application and then you can use it to run\nthe tests.  For example, to run the tests for the core project.\ncd core\nbundle exec rake test_app\nbundle exec rspec spec\nIf you would like to run specs against a particular database you may specify the\ndummy apps database, which defaults to sqlite3.\nDB=postgres bundle exec rake test_app\nIf you want to run specs for only a single spec file\nbundle exec rspec spec/models/spree/state_spec.rb\nIf you want to run a particular line of spec\nbundle exec rspec spec/models/spree/state_spec.rb:7\nYou can also enable fail fast in order to stop tests at the first failure\nFAIL_FAST=true bundle exec rspec spec/models/state_spec.rb\nIf you want to run the simplecov code coverage report\nCOVERAGE=true bundle exec rspec spec\nIf you're working on multiple facets of Spree to test,\nplease ensure that you have a postgres user:\ncreateuser -s -r postgres\nAnd also ensure that you have PhantomJS installed as well:\nbrew update && brew install phantomjs\nTo execute all the tests, you may want to run this command at the\nroot of the Spree project to generate test applications and run\nspecs for all the facets:\nbash build.sh\nContributing\nSpree is an open source project and we encourage contributions.

    "Name": "gnat",
    "Readme": "== Welcome to Rails\n\nRails is a web-application and persistence framework that includes everything\nneeded to create database-backed web-applications according to the\nModel-View-Control pattern of separation. This pattern splits the view (also\ncalled the presentation) into \"dumb\" templates that are primarily responsible\nfor inserting pre-built data in between HTML tags. The model contains the\n\"smart\" domain objects (such as Account, Product, Person, Post) that holds all\nthe business logic and knows how to persist themselves to a database. The\ncontroller handles the incoming requests (such as Save New Account, Update\nProduct, Show Post) by manipulating the model and directing data to the view.\n\nIn Rails, the model is handled by what's called an object-relational mapping\nlayer entitled Active Record. This layer allows you to present the data from\ndatabase rows as objects and embellish these data objects with business logic\nmethods. You can read more about Active Record in\nlink:files/vendor/rails/activerecord/README.html.\n\nThe controller and view are handled by the Action Pack, which handles both\nlayers by its two parts: Action View and Action Controller. These two layers\nare bundled in a single package due to their heavy interdependence. This is\nunlike the relationship between the Active Record and Action Pack that is much\nmore separate. Each of these packages can be used independently outside of\nRails.  You can read more about Action Pack in\nlink:files/vendor/rails/actionpack/README.html.\n\n\n== Getting Started\n\n1. At the command prompt, start a new Rails application using the <tt>rails</tt> command\n   and your application name. Ex: rails myapp\n   (If you've downloaded Rails in a complete tgz or zip, this step is already done)\n2. Change directory into myapp and start the web server: <tt>script/server</tt> (run with --help for options)\n3. Go to http://localhost:3000/ and get \"Welcome aboard: You\u2019re riding the Rails!\"\n4. Follow the guidelines to start developing your application\n\n\n== Web Servers\n\nBy default, Rails will try to use Mongrel and lighttpd if they are installed, otherwise\nRails will use WEBrick, the webserver that ships with Ruby. When you run script/server,\nRails will check if Mongrel exists, then lighttpd and finally fall back to WEBrick. This ensures\nthat you can always get up and running quickly.\n\nMongrel is a Ruby-based webserver with a C component (which requires compilation) that is\nsuitable for development and deployment of Rails applications. If you have Ruby Gems installed,\ngetting up and running with mongrel is as easy as: <tt>gem install mongrel</tt>.\nMore info at: http://mongrel.rubyforge.org\n\nIf Mongrel is not installed, Rails will look for lighttpd. It's considerably faster than\nMongrel and WEBrick and also suited for production use, but requires additional\ninstallation and currently only works well on OS X/Unix (Windows users are encouraged\nto start with Mongrel). We recommend version 1.4.11 and higher. You can download it from\nhttp://www.lighttpd.net.\n\nAnd finally, if neither Mongrel or lighttpd are installed, Rails will use the built-in Ruby\nweb server, WEBrick. WEBrick is a small Ruby web server suitable for development, but not\nfor production.\n\nBut of course its also possible to run Rails on any platform that supports FCGI.\nApache, LiteSpeed, IIS are just a few. For more information on FCGI,\nplease visit: http://wiki.rubyonrails.com/rails/pages/FastCGI\n\n\n== Debugging Rails\n\nSometimes your application goes wrong.  Fortunately there are a lot of tools that\nwill help you debug it and get it back on the rails.\n\nFirst area to check is the application log files.  Have \"tail -f\" commands running\non the server.log and development.log. Rails will automatically display debugging\nand runtime information to these files. Debugging info will also be shown in the\nbrowser on requests from 127.0.0.1.\n\nYou can also log your own messages directly into the log file from your code using\nthe Ruby logger class from inside your controllers. Example:\n\n  class WeblogController < ActionController::Base\n    def destroy\n      @weblog = Weblog.find(params[:id])\n      @weblog.destroy\n      logger.info(\"#{Time.now} Destroyed Weblog ID ##{@weblog.id}!\")\n    end\n  end\n\nThe result will be a message in your log file along the lines of:\n\n  Mon Oct 08 14:22:29 +1000 2007 Destroyed Weblog ID #1\n\nMore information on how to use the logger is at http://www.ruby-doc.org/core/\n\nAlso, Ruby documentation can be found at http://www.ruby-lang.org/ including:\n\n* The Learning Ruby (Pickaxe) Book: http://www.ruby-doc.org/docs/ProgrammingRuby/\n* Learn to Program: http://pine.fm/LearnToProgram/  (a beginners guide)\n\nThese two online (and free) books will bring you up to speed on the Ruby language\nand also on programming in general.\n\n\n== Debugger\n\nDebugger support is available through the debugger command when you start your Mongrel or\nWebrick server with --debugger. This means that you can break out of execution at any point\nin the code, investigate and change the model, AND then resume execution! Example:\n\n  class WeblogController < ActionController::Base\n    def index\n      @posts = Post.find(:all)\n      debugger\n    end\n  end\n\nSo the controller will accept the action, run the first line, then present you\nwith a IRB prompt in the server window. Here you can do things like:\n\n  >> @posts.inspect\n  => \"[#<Post:0x14a6be8 @attributes={\\\"title\\\"=>nil, \\\"body\\\"=>nil, \\\"id\\\"=>\\\"1\\\"}>,\n       #<Post:0x14a6620 @attributes={\\\"title\\\"=>\\\"Rails you know!\\\", \\\"body\\\"=>\\\"Only ten..\\\", \\\"id\\\"=>\\\"2\\\"}>]\"\n  >> @posts.first.title = \"hello from a debugger\"\n  => \"hello from a debugger\"\n\n...and even better is that you can examine how your runtime objects actually work:\n\n  >> f = @posts.first\n  => #<Post:0x13630c4 @attributes={\"title\"=>nil, \"body\"=>nil, \"id\"=>\"1\"}>\n  >> f.\n  Display all 152 possibilities? (y or n)\n\nFinally, when you're ready to resume execution, you enter \"cont\"\n\n\n== Console\n\nYou can interact with the domain model by starting the console through <tt>script/console</tt>.\nHere you'll have all parts of the application configured, just like it is when the\napplication is running. You can inspect domain models, change values, and save to the\ndatabase. Starting the script without arguments will launch it in the development environment.\nPassing an argument will specify a different environment, like <tt>script/console production</tt>.\n\nTo reload your controllers and models after launching the console run <tt>reload!</tt>\n\n\n== Description of Contents\n\napp\n  Holds all the code that's specific to this particular application.\n\napp/controllers\n  Holds controllers that should be named like weblogs_controller.rb for\n  automated URL mapping. All controllers should descend from ApplicationController\n  which itself descends from ActionController::Base.\n\napp/models\n  Holds models that should be named like post.rb.\n  Most models will descend from ActiveRecord::Base.\n\napp/views\n  Holds the template files for the view that should be named like\n  weblogs/index.erb for the WeblogsController#index action. All views use eRuby\n  syntax.\n\napp/views/layouts\n  Holds the template files for layouts to be used with views. This models the common\n  header/footer method of wrapping views. In your views, define a layout using the\n  <tt>layout :default</tt> and create a file named default.erb. Inside default.erb,\n  call <% yield %> to render the view using this layout.\n\napp/helpers\n  Holds view helpers that should be named like weblogs_helper.rb. These are generated\n  for you automatically when using script/generate for controllers. Helpers can be used to\n  wrap functionality for your views into methods.\n\nconfig\n  Configuration files for the Rails environment, the routing map, the database, and other dependencies.\n\ndb\n  Contains the database schema in schema.rb.  db/migrate contains all\n  the sequence of Migrations for your schema.\n\ndoc\n  This directory is where your application documentation will be stored when generated\n  using <tt>rake doc:app</tt>\n\nlib\n  Application specific libraries. Basically, any kind of custom code that doesn't\n  belong under controllers, models, or helpers. This directory is in the load path.\n\npublic\n  The directory available for the web server. Contains subdirectories for images, stylesheets,\n  and javascripts. Also contains the dispatchers and the default HTML files. This should be\n  set as the DOCUMENT_ROOT of your web server.\n\nscript\n  Helper scripts for automation and generation.\n\ntest\n  Unit and functional tests along with fixtures. When using the script/generate scripts, template\n  test files will be generated for you and placed in this directory.\n\nvendor\n  External libraries that the application depends on. Also includes the plugins subdirectory.\n  This directory is in the load path.\n\n",

    "Readme": "= godo\n\n* version: 1.0.9\n* released: 2008-06-02\n* http://simplyruby.rubyforge.org/godo\n\n== DESCRIPTION:\n\ngo (to project) do (stuffs)\n\ngodo provides a smart way of opening a project folder in multiple terminal tabs and, in each tab,\ninvoking a commands appropriate to that project. For example if the folder contains a Rails project\nthe actions might include: starting mongrel, tailing one or more logs, starting consoles or IRB\nsessions, tailing production logs, opening an editor, running autospec, or gitk.\n\ngodo works by searching your project paths for a given search string and trying to match it against\npaths found in one or more configured project roots. It will make some straightforward efforts to\ndisambiguate among multiple matches to find the one you want.\n\ngodo then uses configurable heuristics to figure out what type of project it is, for example \"a RoR\nproject using RSpec and Subversion\". From that it will invokes a series of action appropriate to the type of project detected with each action being run, from the project folder, in its own terminal session.\n\ngodo is entirely configured by a YAML file (~/.godo) that contains project types, heuristics, actions, project paths, and a session controller. A sample configuration file is provided that can be installed using godo --install.\n\ngodo comes with an iTerm session controller for MacOSX that uses the rb-appscript gem to control iTerm (see lib/session.rb and lib/sessions/iterm_session.rb). It should be relatively straightforward to add new controller (e.g. for Leopard Terminal.app), or a controller that works in a different way (e.g. by creating new windows instead of new tabs). There is nothing MacOSX specific about the rest of godo so creating controllers for other unixen should be straightforward if they can be controlled from ruby.\n\ngodo is a rewrite of my original 'gp' script (http://matt.blogs.it/entries/00002674.html) which fixes a number of the deficiencies of that script, turns it into a gem, has a better name, and steals the idea of using heuristics to detect project types from Solomon White's gp variant (http://onrails.org/articles/2007/11/28/scripting-the-leopard-terminal).\n\ngodo now includes contributions from Lee Marlow <lee.marlow@gmail.com> including support for project level .godo files to override the global configuration, support for Terminal.app, and maximum depth support to speed up the finder.\n\ngodo lives at the excellent GitHub: http://github.com/mmower/godo/ and accepts patches and forks.\n\n== FEATURES/PROBLEMS:\n\n* All-in-one configuration file\n* Flexible heuristics for detecting project type\n* Flexible actions for running commands\n* Project level customizations\n\n== SYNOPSIS:\n\nTo install the default configuration (will not overwrite an existing configuration file)\n\ngodo --install\n\nTo open a project with it's actions\n\ngodo <project>\n\nWhere project is a search term that will match part of the project path name.\n\nIf the project has a .godo file at its root, then those actions will be used\ninstead of using the heuristics.  A project level .godo file can reference\nactions defined in ~/.godo, a group of actions by project type, and\narbitrary commands.\n\nHere's a sample project level .godo file:\n---\nactions:\n  - terminal\n  - command: echo 'tab before matcher'\n    label: This tab goes before the project matcher\n  - matcher: rails+git\n  - command: echo 'tab after matcher'\n  - terminal\n\nTo open a project and override the project type (i.e. do not use heuristics nor\na project level .godo file):\n\ngodo -o <matcher> <project>\n\nTo see what project types are available:\n\ngodo --list-types\n\n== REQUIREMENTS:\n\n* Trollop\n* rb-appscript\n\n== INSTALL:\n\n* sudo gem install godo\n* godo --install\n* mate|vi|emacs ~/.godo\n\n== LICENSE:\n\n(The MIT License)\n\nCopyright (c) 2008 Matt Mower <self@mattmower.com>\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining\na copy of this software and associated documentation files (the\n'Software'), to deal in the Software without restriction, including\nwithout limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish,\ndistribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to\npermit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to\nthe following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be\nincluded in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED 'AS IS', WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,\nEXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF\nMERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.\nIN NO EVENT SHALL THE AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY\nCLAIM, DAMAGES OR OTHER LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT,\nTORT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM, OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE\nSOFTWARE OR THE USE OR OTHER DEALINGS IN THE SOFTWARE.\n\n",

Get the {0.9.8 snapshot}[http://www.sphinxsearch.com/downloads.html], then run <tt>./configure</tt>, <tt>make</tt>, and <tt>sudo make install</tt>. Make sure to set your <tt>./configure</tt> flags: <tt>----prefix</tt> if necessary, and also <tt>----with-pgsql</tt> if you need Postgres support.\n\nYou also need the <tt>chronic</tt> gem:\n  sudo gem install chronic\n\nThen, install the plugin:\n  script/plugin install -x svn://rubyforge.org/var/svn/fauna/ultrasphinx/trunk\n\nNext, copy the <tt>examples/default.base</tt> file to <tt>RAILS_ROOT/config/ultrasphinx/default.base</tt>. This file sets up the  Sphinx daemon options such as port, host, and index location.\n\nIf you need per-environment configuration, you can use <tt>RAILS_ROOT/config/ultrasphinx/development.base</tt>, etc. Note that ERb is also allowed within the <tt>.base</tt> files, and can be an alternative way to DRY up multiple configurations.\n\nNow, in your models, use the <tt>is_indexed</tt> method to configure a model as searchable. For example:\n\n  class Post\n    is_indexed :fields => ['created_at', 'title', 'body']\n  end\n\nFor more index options, see ActiveRecord::Base .is_indexed.\n\n== Building the index\n\nNow run:\n\n  rake ultrasphinx:configure\n  rake ultrasphinx:index\n  rake ultrasphinx:daemon:start\n\nTo rotate the index, just rerun <tt>rake ultrasphinx:index</tt>. If the search daemon is running, it will have its index rotated live. Otherwise the new index will be installed but the daemon will remain stopped.\n\n== Running queries\n\nQuery the daemon as so:\n\n  @search = Ultrasphinx::Search.new(:query => @query)\n  @search.run\n  @search.results\n\nFor more query options, including excerpt mode, see Ultrasphinx::Search.\n\n= Extras  \n\n== Pagination\n\nOnce the <tt>@search</tt> object has been <tt>run</tt>, it is directly compatible with the <tt>will_paginate</tt> view helper. In your view, just do:\n  <%= will_paginate(@search) %>\n\n== Spell checking\n\nSee Ultrasphinx::Spell.\n\n== Delta indexing \n\nDelta indexing speeds up your updates by not reindexing the entire dataset every time. \n\nFirst, in your <tt>.base</tt> file, set the indexer option <tt>delta</tt> to your maximum interval between full reindexes. A day or a week is good, depending. Add a little bit to account for the time it takes the actual index to run:\n\n  delta = <%= 1.day + 30.minutes %> \n\nNow, configure your models for delta indexing in the <tt>is_indexed</tt> call:\n\n  is_indexed :fields => ['created_at', 'title', 'body'],\n    :delta => true\n\nNow you can run <tt>rake ultrasphinx:index:delta</tt> frequently, and only records that were changed within 1 day will be reindexed. You will need to run <tt>rake ultrasphinx:index:main</tt> once a day to move the delta contents into the main index.\n\nSee ActiveRecord::Base .is_indexed and DEPLOYMENT_NOTES[link:files/DEPLOYMENT_NOTES.html] for more.\n\n== Available Rake tasks\n\nSee RAKE_TASKS[link:files/RAKE_TASKS.html].\n\n== Deployment notes\n\nSee DEPLOYMENT_NOTES[link:files/DEPLOYMENT_NOTES.html].\n\n== Gotchas\n\nNote that since Ultrasphinx preloads indexed models, you need to make sure those models have their own dependencies in place early in the boot process. This may require adjusting the general plugin load order or moving monkey-patches from <tt>lib/</tt> to <tt>vendor/plugins/</tt>.\n\nPostgreSQL 8.2 and higher are well supported. However, make sure the stored procedure migration gets generated correctly. If you did not install the plugin via <tt>script/install</tt>, run <tt>script/generate ultrasphinx_migration</tt> by hand.\n\n== Reporting problems\n\nThe support forum is here[http://rubyforge.org/forum/forum.php?forum_id=14244].\n\nPatches and contributions are very welcome.

    "Readme": "== Welcome to Rails\n\nRails is a web-application and persistence framework that includes everything\nneeded to create database-backed web-applications according to the\nModel-View-Control pattern of separation. This pattern splits the view (also\ncalled the presentation) into \"dumb\" templates that are primarily responsible\nfor inserting pre-built data in between HTML tags. The model contains the\n\"smart\" domain objects (such as Account, Product, Person, Post) that holds all\nthe business logic and knows how to persist themselves to a database. The\ncontroller handles the incoming requests (such as Save New Account, Update\nProduct, Show Post) by manipulating the model and directing data to the view.\n\nIn Rails, the model is handled by what's called an object-relational mapping\nlayer entitled Active Record. This layer allows you to present the data from\ndatabase rows as objects and embellish these data objects with business logic\nmethods. You can read more about Active Record in\nlink:files/vendor/rails/activerecord/README.html.\n\nThe controller and view are handled by the Action Pack, which handles both\nlayers by its two parts: Action View and Action Controller. These two layers\nare bundled in a single package due to their heavy interdependence. This is\nunlike the relationship between the Active Record and Action Pack that is much\nmore separate. Each of these packages can be used independently outside of\nRails.  You can read more about Action Pack in\nlink:files/vendor/rails/actionpack/README.html.\n\n\n== Getting Started\n\n1. At the command prompt, start a new Rails application using the <tt>rails</tt> command\n   and your application name. Ex: rails myapp\n   (If you've downloaded Rails in a complete tgz or zip, this step is already done)\n2. Change directory into myapp and start the web server: <tt>script/server</tt> (run with --help for options)\n3. Go to http://localhost:3000/ and get \"Welcome aboard: You\u2019re riding the Rails!\"\n4. Follow the guidelines to start developing your application\n\n\n== Web Servers\n\nBy default, Rails will try to use Mongrel and lighttpd if they are installed, otherwise\nRails will use WEBrick, the webserver that ships with Ruby. When you run script/server,\nRails will check if Mongrel exists, then lighttpd and finally fall back to WEBrick. This ensures\nthat you can always get up and running quickly.\n\nMongrel is a Ruby-based webserver with a C component (which requires compilation) that is\nsuitable for development and deployment of Rails applications. If you have Ruby Gems installed,\ngetting up and running with mongrel is as easy as: <tt>gem install mongrel</tt>.\nMore info at: http://mongrel.rubyforge.org\n\nIf Mongrel is not installed, Rails will look for lighttpd. It's considerably faster than\nMongrel and WEBrick and also suited for production use, but requires additional\ninstallation and currently only works well on OS X/Unix (Windows users are encouraged\nto start with Mongrel). We recommend version 1.4.11 and higher. You can download it from\nhttp://www.lighttpd.net.\n\nAnd finally, if neither Mongrel or lighttpd are installed, Rails will use the built-in Ruby\nweb server, WEBrick. WEBrick is a small Ruby web server suitable for development, but not\nfor production.\n\nBut of course its also possible to run Rails on any platform that supports FCGI.\nApache, LiteSpeed, IIS are just a few. For more information on FCGI,\nplease visit: http://wiki.rubyonrails.com/rails/pages/FastCGI\n\n\n== Debugging Rails\n\nSometimes your application goes wrong.  Fortunately there are a lot of tools that\nwill help you debug it and get it back on the rails.\n\nFirst area to check is the application log files.  Have \"tail -f\" commands running\non the server.log and development.log. Rails will automatically display debugging\nand runtime information to these files. Debugging info will also be shown in the\nbrowser on requests from 127.0.0.1.\n\nYou can also log your own messages directly into the log file from your code using\nthe Ruby logger class from inside your controllers. Example:\n\n  class WeblogController < ActionController::Base\n    def destroy\n      @weblog = Weblog.find(params[:id])\n      @weblog.destroy\n      logger.info(\"#{Time.now} Destroyed Weblog ID ##{@weblog.id}!\")\n    end\n  end\n\nThe result will be a message in your log file along the lines of:\n\n  Mon Oct 08 14:22:29 +1000 2007 Destroyed Weblog ID #1\n\nMore information on how to use the logger is at http://www.ruby-doc.org/core/\n\nAlso, Ruby documentation can be found at http://www.ruby-lang.org/ including:\n\n* The Learning Ruby (Pickaxe) Book: http://www.ruby-doc.org/docs/ProgrammingRuby/\n* Learn to Program: http://pine.fm/LearnToProgram/  (a beginners guide)\n\nThese two online (and free) books will bring you up to speed on the Ruby language\nand also on programming in general.\n\n\n== Debugger\n\nDebugger support is available through the debugger command when you start your Mongrel or\nWebrick server with --debugger. This means that you can break out of execution at any point\nin the code, investigate and change the model, AND then resume execution! Example:\n\n  class WeblogController < ActionController::Base\n    def index\n      @posts = Post.find(:all)\n      debugger\n    end\n  end\n\nSo the controller will accept the action, run the first line, then present you\nwith a IRB prompt in the server window. Here you can do things like:\n\n  >> @posts.inspect\n  => \"[#<Post:0x14a6be8 @attributes={\\\"title\\\"=>nil, \\\"body\\\"=>nil, \\\"id\\\"=>\\\"1\\\"}>,\n       #<Post:0x14a6620 @attributes={\\\"title\\\"=>\\\"Rails you know!\\\", \\\"body\\\"=>\\\"Only ten..\\\", \\\"id\\\"=>\\\"2\\\"}>]\"\n  >> @posts.first.title = \"hello from a debugger\"\n  => \"hello from a debugger\"\n\n...and even better is that you can examine how your runtime objects actually work:\n\n  >> f = @posts.first\n  => #<Post:0x13630c4 @attributes={\"title\"=>nil, \"body\"=>nil, \"id\"=>\"1\"}>\n  >> f.\n  Display all 152 possibilities? (y or n)\n\nFinally, when you're ready to resume execution, you enter \"cont\"\n\n\n== Console\n\nYou can interact with the domain model by starting the console through <tt>script/console</tt>.\nHere you'll have all parts of the application configured, just like it is when the\napplication is running. You can inspect domain models, change values, and save to the\ndatabase. Starting the script without arguments will launch it in the development environment.\nPassing an argument will specify a different environment, like <tt>script/console production</tt>.\n\nTo reload your controllers and models after launching the console run <tt>reload!</tt>\n\n\n== Description of Contents\n\napp\n  Holds all the code that's specific to this particular application.\n\napp/controllers\n  Holds controllers that should be named like weblogs_controller.rb for\n  automated URL mapping. All controllers should descend from ApplicationController\n  which itself descends from ActionController::Base.\n\napp/models\n  Holds models that should be named like post.rb.\n  Most models will descend from ActiveRecord::Base.\n\napp/views\n  Holds the template files for the view that should be named like\n  weblogs/index.erb for the WeblogsController#index action. All views use eRuby\n  syntax.\n\napp/views/layouts\n  Holds the template files for layouts to be used with views. This models the common\n  header/footer method of wrapping views. In your views, define a layout using the\n  <tt>layout :default</tt> and create a file named default.erb. Inside default.erb,\n  call <% yield %> to render the view using this layout.\n\napp/helpers\n  Holds view helpers that should be named like weblogs_helper.rb. These are generated\n  for you automatically when using script/generate for controllers. Helpers can be used to\n  wrap functionality for your views into methods.\n\nconfig\n  Configuration files for the Rails environment, the routing map, the database, and other dependencies.\n\ndb\n  Contains the database schema in schema.rb.  db/migrate contains all\n  the sequence of Migrations for your schema.\n\ndoc\n  This directory is where your application documentation will be stored when generated\n  using <tt>rake doc:app</tt>\n\nlib\n  Application specific libraries. Basically, any kind of custom code that doesn't\n  belong under controllers, models, or helpers. This directory is in the load path.\n\npublic\n  The directory available for the web server. Contains subdirectories for images, stylesheets,\n  and javascripts. Also contains the dispatchers and the default HTML files. This should be\n  set as the DOCUMENT_ROOT of your web server.\n\nscript\n  Helper scripts for automation and generation.\n\ntest\n  Unit and functional tests along with fixtures. When using the script/generate scripts, template\n  test files will be generated for you and placed in this directory.\n\nvendor\n  External libraries that the application depends on. Also includes the plugins subdirectory.\n  This directory is in the load path.\n\n",

    "Readme": "\n\nThe future is bright\nalonetone is an independent music platform, allowing musicians to host and distribute their music in a non-commercial, easy-to-use environment.\nalonetone launched in January 2008. As of 2015 it hosts over 58,000 tracks from 4500 musicians. We have delivered over 4.5 million mp3s to real listeners (not google and spambots, we are strict about excluding em!)\nBug reporting\nWe use Github Issues to submit bugs and keep track of our work.\nOur goal?\nTo create and run the best online home a musician could want to have. To provide them with the tools they need to reach  listeners and network with other artists \u2014\u00a0without the stank of commercialism, startup flava, ads, etc. \nWe strive to build:\n\nAn easy to use, straightforward, intuitive, and consistent interface. Grandma-friendly (Yes, my grandma does use alonetone).\nAttractive to look at. UI-first feature building. Designer always involved.\nAn open-source rails app that is easy to setup, adheres to best practices and can serve as good example.\nPractical, useful tools and services for musicians \u2014 without too much clutter and junk (no facebook integration, etc)\nEncourage artist exploration and a sense of community: encouragement to stick around vs. cliqueyness\nIt does not overwhelm folks with TMI (too much information) or TMO (too many options) or TMF (too many features).\n\nNew Features must prove themselves and obey the above principles \u2014 not just be built because it sounds cool or would be fun to hack on. We have said \"no\" to many \"intuitive\" or \"easy\" features like threaded comment replies because they would compromise or distract from the above goals. \nFor more info on alonetone, visit the alonetone faq\nCurrent tech\n\nRails 4.2\njQuery\nSoundManager 2 (for flash + html5 playback)\n\nCurrent feature set\n\nUnlimited mp3 uploads for musicians\nCreation of playlists / albums\nMP3 streaming and download (powered by amazon s3)\nArtist browsing\nTrack browsing by popularity, who you are following, most favorited, etc.\nTracking of listens and providing useful feedback and statistics to artists\nOne-way commenting system (No inline relpies. No threaded comments. No \"pms\")\nFeeds for iTunes podcasts and offsite flash players\n\nFeatures wanted\nBrowse All Playlists\nLow hanging fruit, boys and girls! Shoulda been a 2008 feature :)\nOn the fly zip downloads of playlists via nginx mod_zip\nThis is very easy. Already implemented on Ramen Music. Essentially just is a having a controller generate a text file of filenames that nginx interrupts and uses to construct a zip that's sent back to the client.\nBetter discovery though tags\nIt's high time. We're small fries perhaps (40k tracks) but we lack any categorization outside of playlists and users. The community has decided NO GENRES and after a bunch of discussion, we've decided going with tags (chosen by the uploader) is likely best. However, problems ensue, including: \n    1) If it's a free for all, won't it just be like genres, but messy? \n    2) Should the tags  be moderated and exclude genres? \n    3) What to do about tagging all the old music, should moderators be able to adjust and add tags for the lazy users/old tracks? \n    4) Should there be a maximum enforced for UI purposes?\nThis is more than just programming, it's ultimately a UI issue. We can look to Ramen's tag implementation (4-5 maximum, taking up 1-2 lines) for inspiration, but it's very easy to do this wrong.\nBetter overall alonetone stats page.\nWe need to expose a bit more info to the admins/mods. We want to see how signups/assets/comments are trending to help us catch anything strange or cool. But we also just want to know some useful stuff.\nUser stats page\nPartial implementation/proof of concept was working on rails 2 branch. Basically, a track-by-track table-view of listens, downloads, sources, etc, along with a graph over time for each track. \nA way to manage blacklisted IPs in the backend.\nWe get trouble with downloading bots, spambots. We have manually hardcoded IPs in the source, specefically to prevent downloading mp3 and wasting our bandwidth. We need to create a UI so this can be managed by a non-techie moderator. Also, we need to provide logged in users with a \"report\" action on their listens if they notice sketchy behavior, so it can go upstream to the mods.\nGroups.\nTalk with Sudara about this. There's a partial half-hearted implementation. \nRemove alonetone branding from the code\nIt would be nice to separate the alonetone branding, email address, url, and so on \u2014\u00a0out into config files.\nWant to deploy alonetone on your server?\n\nIt's not going to happen unless:\n\nYou know ruby on rails well (Been doing it for more than a few months).\nYou have deployed rails applications, and are comfortable with that.\nYou are willing to spend 20+ hours removing our branding and logo and site-specific things from the code.\n\nWe get a LOT of requests from rails n00bs asking if we can help them setup this \"script\" because they want an alonetone for a certain region of the world, or in another language. \nPlease understand that alonetone is open-source as an educational tool, to encourage collaboration, and for transparency. It is not intended as a white-label solution. If you are serious about getting a copy in production, it's going to take lots of work (like 40+ hours) since it's not intended for that purpose.\nIf you still decide to try keep in mind we are unable to provide ANY support \nWant to help make alonetone.com awesome?\nSweet, now we are talkin'!\nFirst, sign up for an account and start digging in.\nSecond, hop into our Campfire chat room or email us at support@alonetone.com\nThirdly, fork away on github.\nSetup alonetone on localhost\n1) clone\n2) brew install libsndfile (required for ruby-audio gem)\n2) bundle\n3) Create needed config, database, and load db/seeds:\n  rake setup\n\n4) rails s\nNote: alonetone uses 3 config files that are created by 'rake setup'\n  alonetone.yml (contains the application \"secret\" and app-specific settings)\n  database.yml\n  newrelic.yml (for performance tracking)\n\nIssue with event machine 1.0.7?\nbrew link openssl --force\nNo sound on development? Set play_dummy_mp3s: true in alonetone.yml\nLogging in\nAfter the bootstrap data is loaded, you can login using the test account.

    "Readme": "attachmerb-fu\n=====================\n\nattachmerb_fu is a port of Rick Olson's famous attachment_fu Rails plugin to merb. It tries to be as orm-agnostic as merb while having the same functionalities as the original plugin.\n\nThis plugin is still in a very alpha state and was only tested with datamapper orm, mini_magick image processor and filesystem storage. It may or may not work for your application\n\nNote: attachmerb_fu requires Merb >= 0.5\n\n\nattachmerb_fu functionality\n===========================\n\nattachmerb_fu facilitates file uploads in Merb.  There are a few storage options for the actual file data, but the plugin always at a minimum stores metadata for each file in the database.\n\nThere are three storage options for files uploaded through attachmerb_fu:\n  File system\n  Database file (currently not tested)\n  Amazon S3 (currently not tested)\n\nEach method of storage many options associated with it that will be covered in the following section.  Something to note, however, is that the Amazon S3 storage requires you to modify config/amazon_s3.yml and the Database file storage requires an extra table.\n\n\nattachmerb_fu models\n====================\n\nFor all three of these storage options a table of metadata is required.  This table will contain information about the file (hence the 'meta') and its location.  This table has no restrictions on naming, unlike the extra table required for database storage, which must have a table name of db_files (and by convention a model of DbFile).\n\nIn the model there are two methods made available by this plugins: has_attachment and validates_as_attachment.\n\nhas_attachment(options = {})\n  This method accepts the options in a hash:\n    :content_type     # Allowed content types.\n                      # Allows all by default.  Use :image to allow all standard image types.\n    :min_size         # Minimum size allowed.\n                      # 1 byte is the default.\n    :max_size         # Maximum size allowed.\n                      # 1.megabyte is the default.\n    :size             # Range of sizes allowed.\n                      # (1..1.megabyte) is the default.  This overrides the :min_size and :max_size options.\n    :resize_to        # Used by RMagick to resize images.\n                      # Pass either an array of width/height, or a geometry string.\n    :thumbnails       # Specifies a set of thumbnails to generate.\n                      # This accepts a hash of filename suffixes and RMagick resizing options.\n                      # This option need only be included if you want thumbnailing.\n    :thumbnail_class  # Set which model class to use for thumbnails.\n                      # This current attachment class is used by default.\n    :path_prefix      # path to store the uploaded files.\n                      # Uses public/#{table_name} by default for the filesystem, and just #{table_name} for the S3 backend.  \n                      # Setting this sets the :storage to :file_system.\n    :storage          # Specifies the storage system to use..\n                      # Defaults to :db_file.  Options are :file_system, :db_file, and :s3.\n    :processor        # Sets the image processor to use for resizing of the attached image.\n                      # Options include ImageScience, Rmagick, and MiniMagick.  Default is whatever is installed.\n\n\n  Examples:\n    has_attachment :max_size => 1.kilobyte\n    has_attachment :size => 1.megabyte..2.megabytes\n    has_attachment :content_type => 'application/pdf'\n    has_attachment :content_type => ['application/pdf', 'application/msword', 'text/plain']\n    has_attachment :content_type => :image, :resize_to => [50,50]\n    has_attachment :content_type => ['application/pdf', :image], :resize_to => 'x50'\n    has_attachment :thumbnails => { :thumb => [50, 50], :geometry => 'x50' }\n    has_attachment :storage => :file_system, :path_prefix => 'public/files'\n    has_attachment :storage => :file_system, :path_prefix => 'public/files', \n                   :content_type => :image, :resize_to => [50,50]\n    has_attachment :storage => :file_system, :path_prefix => 'public/files',\n                   :thumbnails => { :thumb => [50, 50], :geometry => 'x50' }\n    has_attachment :storage => :s3\n\nvalidates_as_attachment\n  This method prevents files outside of the valid range (:min_size to :max_size, or the :size range) from being saved.  It does not however, halt the upload of such files.  They will be uploaded into memory regardless of size before validation.\n\n  Example:\n    validates_as_attachment\n\n\nattachmerb_fu migrations\n========================\n\nFields for attachmerb_fu metadata tables...\n  in general:\n    size,         :integer  # file size in bytes\n    content_type, :string   # mime type, ex: application/mp3\n    filename,     :string   # sanitized filename\n  that reference images:\n    height,       :integer  # in pixels\n    width,        :integer  # in pixels\n  that reference images that will be thumbnailed:\n    parent_id,    :integer  # id of parent image (on the same table, a self-referencing foreign-key).\n                            # Only populated if the current object is a thumbnail.\n    thumbnail,    :string   # the 'type' of thumbnail this attachment record describes.  \n                            # Only populated if the current object is a thumbnail.\n                            # Usage:\n                            # [ In Model 'Avatar' ]\n                            #   has_attachment :content_type => :image, \n                            #                  :storage => :file_system, \n                            #                  :max_size => 500.kilobytes,\n                            #                  :resize_to => '320x200>',\n                            #                  :thumbnails => { :small => '10x10>',\n                            #                                   :thumb => '100x100>' }\n                            # [ Elsewhere ]\n                            # @user.avatar.thumbnails.first.thumbnail #=> 'small'\n  that reference files stored in the database (:db_file):\n    db_file_id,   :integer  # id of the file in the database (foreign key)\n\nField for attachmerb_fu db_files table:\n  data, :binary # binary file data, for use in database file storage\n\n\nattachmerb_fu views\n===================\n\nThere are two main views tasks that will be directly affected by attachmerb_fu: upload forms and displaying uploaded images.\n\nThere are two parts of the upload form that differ from typical usage.\n  1. Include ':multipart => true' in the html options of the form_for tag.\n    Example:\n      <% form_for(:attachment_metadata, :url => { :action => \"create\" }, :html => { :multipart => true }) do |form| %>\n\n  2. Use the file_field helper with :uploaded_data as the field name.\n    Example:\n      <%= form.file_field :uploaded_data %>\n\nDisplaying uploaded images is made easy by the public_filename method of the ActiveRecord attachment objects using file system and s3 storage.\n\npublic_filename(thumbnail = nil)\n  Returns the public path to the file.  If a thumbnail prefix is specified it will return the public file path to the corresponding thumbnail.\n  Examples:\n    attachment_obj.public_filename          #=> /attachments/2/file.jpg\n    attachment_obj.public_filename(:thumb)  #=> /attachments/2/file_thumb.jpg\n    attachment_obj.public_filename(:small)  #=> /attachments/2/file_small.jpg\n\nWhen serving files from database storage, doing more than simply downloading the file is beyond the scope of this document.\n\n\nattachmerb_fu controllers\n=========================\n\nThere are two considerations to take into account when using attachmerb_fu in controllers.\n\nThe first is when the files have no publicly accessible path and need to be downloaded through an action.\n\nExample:\n  def readme\n    send_file '/path/to/readme.txt', :type => 'plain/text', :disposition => 'inline'\n  end\n\nSee the possible values for send_file for reference.\n\n\nThe second is when saving the file when submitted from a form.\nExample in view:\n <%= form.file_field :attachable, :uploaded_data %>\n\nExample in controller:\n  def create\n    @attachable_file = AttachmentMetadataModel.new(params[:attachable])\n    if @attachable_file.save\n      flash[:notice] = 'Attachment was successfully created.'\n      redirect_to attachable_url(@attachable_file)     \n    else\n      render :action => :new\n    end\n  end\n\n",

This overrides the :min_size and :max_size options.\n    :resize_to        # Used by RMagick to resize images.\n                      # Pass either an array of width/height, or a geometry string.\n    :thumbnails       # Specifies a set of thumbnails to generate.\n                      # This accepts a hash of filename suffixes and RMagick resizing options.\n                      # This option need only be included if you want thumbnailing.\n    :thumbnail_class  # Set which model class to use for thumbnails.\n                      # This current attachment class is used by default.\n    :path_prefix      # path to store the uploaded files.\n                      # Uses public/#{table_name} by default for the filesystem, and just #{table_name} for the S3 backend.  \n                      # Setting this sets the :storage to :file_system.\n    :storage          # Specifies the storage system to use..\n                      # Defaults to :db_file.  Options are :file_system, :db_file, and :s3.\n    :processor        # Sets the image processor to use for resizing of the attached image.\n                      # Options include ImageScience, Rmagick, and MiniMagick.  Default is whatever is installed.\n\n\n  Examples:\n    has_attachment :max_size => 1.kilobyte\n    has_attachment :size => 1.megabyte..2.megabytes\n    has_attachment :content_type => 'application/pdf'\n    has_attachment :content_type => ['application/pdf', 'application/msword', 'text/plain']\n    has_attachment :content_type => :image, :resize_to => [50,50]\n    has_attachment :content_type => ['application/pdf', :image], :resize_to => 'x50'\n    has_attachment :thumbnails => { :thumb => [50, 50], :geometry => 'x50' }\n    has_attachment :storage => :file_system, :path_prefix => 'public/files'\n    has_attachment :storage => :file_system, :path_prefix => 'public/files', \n                   :content_type => :image, :resize_to => [50,50]\n    has_attachment :storage => :file_system, :path_prefix => 'public/files',\n                   :thumbnails => { :thumb => [50, 50], :geometry => 'x50' }\n    has_attachment :storage => :s3\n\nvalidates_as_attachment\n  This method prevents files outside of the valid range (:min_size to :max_size, or the :size range) from being saved.  It does not however, halt the upload of such files.  They will be uploaded into memory regardless of size before validation.\n\n  Example:\n    validates_as_attachment\n\n\nattachment_fu migrations\n========================\n\nFields for attachment_fu metadata tables...\n  in general:\n    size,         :integer  # file size in bytes\n    content_type, :string   # mime type, ex: application/mp3\n    filename,     :string   # sanitized filename\n  that reference images:\n    height,       :integer  # in pixels\n    width,        :integer  # in pixels\n  that reference images that will be thumbnailed:\n    parent_id,    :integer  # id of parent image (on the same table, a self-referencing foreign-key).\n                            # Only populated if the current object is a thumbnail.\n    thumbnail,    :string   # the 'type' of thumbnail this attachment record describes.  \n                            # Only populated if the current object is a thumbnail.\n                            # Usage:\n                            # [ In Model 'Avatar' ]\n                            #   has_attachment :content_type => :image, \n                            #                  :storage => :file_system, \n                            #                  :max_size => 500.kilobytes,\n                            #                  :resize_to => '320x200>',\n                            #                  :thumbnails => { :small => '10x10>',\n                            #                                   :thumb => '100x100>' }\n                            # [ Elsewhere ]\n                            # @user.avatar.thumbnails.first.thumbnail #=> 'small'\n  that reference files stored in the database (:db_file):\n    db_file_id,   :integer  # id of the file in the database (foreign key)\n\nField for attachment_fu db_files table:\n  data, :binary # binary file data, for use in database file storage\n\n\nattachment_fu views\n===================\n\nThere are two main views tasks that will be directly affected by attachment_fu: upload forms and displaying uploaded images.\n\nThere are two parts of the upload form that differ from typical usage.\n  1. Include ':multipart => true' in the html options of the form_for tag.\n    Example:\n      <% form_for(:attachment_metadata, :url => { :action => \"create\" }, :html => { :multipart => true }) do |form| %>\n\n  2. Use the file_field helper with :uploaded_data as the field name.\n    Example:\n      <%= form.file_field :uploaded_data %>\n\nDisplaying uploaded images is made easy by the public_filename method of the ActiveRecord attachment objects using file system and s3 storage.\n\npublic_filename(thumbnail = nil)\n  Returns the public path to the file.  If a thumbnail prefix is specified it will return the public file path to the corresponding thumbnail.\n  Examples:\n    attachment_obj.public_filename          #=> /attachments/2/file.jpg\n    attachment_obj.public_filename(:thumb)  #=> /attachments/2/file_thumb.jpg\n    attachment_obj.public_filename(:small)  #=> /attachments/2/file_small.jpg\n\nWhen serving files from database storage, doing more than simply downloading the file is beyond the scope of this document.\n\n\nattachment_fu controllers\n=========================\n\nThere are two considerations to take into account when using attachment_fu in controllers.\n\nThe first is when the files have no publicly accessible path and need to be downloaded through an action.\n\nExample:\n  def readme\n    send_file '/path/to/readme.txt', :type => 'plain/text', :disposition => 'inline'\n  end\n\nSee the possible values for send_file for reference.\n\n\nThe second is when saving the file when submitted from a form.\nExample in view:\n <%= form.file_field :attachable, :uploaded_data %>\n\nExample in controller:\n  def create\n    @attachable_file = AttachmentMetadataModel.new(params[:attachable])\n    if @attachable_file.save\n      flash[:notice] = 'Attachment was successfully created.'\n      redirect_to attachable_url(@attachable_file)     \n    else\n      render :action => :new\n    end\n  end\n\n",

Service classes \nare composed of instance methods. SWX on Rails will instantiate your service\nclass, call the specified method, and send the response back to the Flash Player.\n\nTake a peek at app/services/hello_world.rb for a working service class example.\nAlright, alright, I'll just show it to you here:\n\n# hello_world.rb----------------------------------------\n# Class and method names follow standard Ruby convention\nclass HelloWorld\n    # Service class methods are instance methods.\n    def just_say_the_words\n        'Hello World!'\n    end\nend\n#-------------------------------------------------------\n\nHere's a Moo card-esque example to call HelloWorld#just_say_the_words from the \nFlash Player (place a MovieClip on stage with an instance name of 'loader' and\nfire up your development server):\n\n//------------------------------------------------------\nloader.serviceClass = \"HelloWorld\";\n// Method names follow ActionScript convention \n// (converted to underscored server-side)\nloader.method = \"justSayTheWords\";\nloader.debug = true;\nloader.loadMovie(\"http://localhost:3000/swx\", \"POST\");\n\nfunction onEnterFrame() {\n // Will output 'Hello World!' once the SWX file is loaded.\n trace(loader.result);\n}\n//------------------------------------------------------\n\nWhen you're ready for some robust ActionScript trickery, head to \nhttp://swxformat.org/download/ to grab the SWX ActionScript library.\n\nOh yeah, you may return ActiveRecord objects from your service classes; \nSWX on Rails will happily serialize them for you. Go ahead, give it a try!\n\nSWX on Rails is beta and may break, throw its toys, eat your\nfirstborn child, etc. \nPlease post bug reports/suggestions to http://groups.google.com/group/swxruby. \nFull-featured tracker coming soon.\n=======================================\nNOTE: You may notice some Security Sandbox Violations when testing the example\nabove in the Flash IDE.

It has two adapters: Mocha\n(with Test::Unit, etc) and RSpec. If adapter is not specified, the\nMocha adapter will be used by default.\nBy default, Synthesis outputs to STDOUT, but output can be\nredirected to alternative IO streams.\nSynthesis can be setup to ignore certain classes or modules when collecting\nexpectations for verification.\nIf pattern is not specified, it will default to\ntest/**/*_test.rb\nAs of version 0.2.0, Synthesis has a DOT formatter which, when\nused, will output text in the DOT graph description language, producing\nsystem visualizations as specified by the simulated interactions in the\nsystem's tests. The output of the DOT formatter can be used\nwith tools like Graphviz( www.graphviz.org/ ). The DOT\nformatter depends on the parse_tree and sexp_processor\nlibraries.\nUsage examples\nTo use with Test::Unit and Mocha, ignoring Array and Hash:\nrequire \"synthesis/task\"\n\nSynthesis::Task.new do |t|\n  t.pattern = 'test/unit/**/*_test.rb'\n  t.ignored = [Array, Hash]\nend\nTo use with RSpec, running all specs in the spec directory:\nrequire \"synthesis/task\"\n\nSynthesis::Task.new do |t|\n  t.adapter = :rspec\n  t.pattern = 'spec/**/*_spec.rb'\nend\nTo to a file:\nrequire \"synthesis/task\"\n\nSynthesis::Task.new do |t|\n  t.out = File.new \"synthesis.test.txt\", \"a\"\nend\nTo output a DOT graph, first make sure you have sexp_processor installed:\nsudo gem install sexp_processor\nThen, to output a file called \u201csynthesis.dot\u201d, do (if formatter_out is not\nspecified, the default ouput is STDOUT):\nrequire \"synthesis/task\"\n\nSynthesis::Task.new do |t|\n  t.formatter = :dot\n  t.formatter_out = \"synthesis.dot\"\nend\nTo use Synthesis with Rails:\nrequire \"synthesis/task\"\n\nSynthesis::Task.new do |t|\n  RAILS_ENV = \"test\"\n  Rake::Task['environment'].invoke # This loads the Rails environment, which may make your build slower. Use only if needed\n  t.pattern = 'test/**/*_test.rb'\nend\nUtilities\nmock_instance\nrequire \"synthesis/util/mock_instance\"\nfoo_mock = Foo.mock_instance(arg_one, arg_2)\nThis is equivalent, but without calling the real initialize\nmethod, to:\nfoo_mock = Foo.new\nFoo.expects(:new).with(arg_one, arg_two).returns(foo_mock)\nOr, in the case of RSpec, it is equivalent to:\nfoo_mock = Foo.new\nFoo.should_receive(:new).with(arg_one, arg_two).and_return(foo_mock)\nEither \"mocha_standalone\" or\n\"spec/mocks\" need to be required before using\nmock_instance.\nGit\nPublic clone URL: git://github.com/gmalamid/synthesis.git\nContributors\nDanilo Sato, Paul Nasrat, Jerome Riga\nDiscuss\ngroups.google.com/group/synthesized-testing\nRelated reading\nnutrun.com/weblog/using-synthesis-with-testunit-and-mocha\n",

    "Readme": "# Apache2 Recipe #\napache2 -- v0.4 by Sam Quigley <sq@wesabe.com>\n\nBasic module for configuring apache via puppet.  Debian/Ubuntu-specific at\nthe moment, but patches are welcome.\n\nBased in part on code by Tim Stoop <tim.stoop@gmail.com> and \nDavid Schmitt <david@schmitt.edv-bus.at>\n\n## Configuration ##\n\nThis module installs apache2 from packages and promptly overwrites the default\nconfiguration with one that does nothing other than include various \ndirectories:\n\n* /etc/apache2/mods-enabled/\n* /etc/apache2/conf.d\n* /etc/apache2/sites-enabled/\n\nDefines are provided to allow recipes and child classes to interact with these\ndirectories -- see below.\n\nAn additional class, `apache2_debian`, is provided which attempts to mimic\nthe default configuration of a freshly-installed debian apache2 package.\n\nA single global configuration variable is available, `$apache2_mpm`, which\ncontrols which of the mpm packages are installed.  Its possible values are:\n\n* 'event':  Use the event driven model (experimental)\n* 'prefork':  Traditional \n* 'worker': High speed threaded model\n\n'worker' is the default.\n\nSee the apache2::debian and apache2::basic subclasses for examples of how to \nuse and configure this class.  Note that these do *NOT* install site \ndefinitions -- so simply including them in a node definition won't work...\n\n### `apache2::config` ###\n\n`apache2::config` installs a configuration snippet in conf.d.  Takes the following options:\n\n* `name`: the name of the config snipppet  [namevar]\n* `ensure`: typically set to \"present\" or \"absent\", but any value legal \nfor a file resource can be used.  Defaults to \"present\"\n* `content`: set this to the text of the snippet -- eg, through \ntemplate().  Defaults to `template(\"apache2/$name.conf.erb\")`, which is\nunlikely to be what you want.\n* `order`: specifies the load order for this config snippet.  the snippet \nwill end up in `/etc/apache2/conf.d/$order-$name.conf`, and apache will load \nfiles in alphanumeric order.  Defaults to \"500\"\n* `require`: if set, this will require that a package of the given name exists\nbefore evaluating the rest of the config definition.  It does not currently\nremove the package, even if ensure is set to absent.\n\n### `apache2::module` ###\n\n`apache2::module` enables an apache module.  It does *NOT* currently install\none for you, except through the \"require\" argument -- see below.  \nOptions are:\n\n* `name`: name of the module.  A file with the name \n`mods-available/$name.load` is expected to exist in the apache2 directory\n* `ensure`: can be \"present\" or \"absent\"\n* `require`: if set, this will require that a package of the given name exists\nbefore evaluating the rest of the module definition.  It does not currently\nremove the package, even if ensure is set to absent.\n\n### `apache2::site` ###\n\n`apache2::site` enables an apache site.  Options are:\n\n* `name`: name of the site.  A file with the name \n`sites-available/$name` is expected to exist in the apache2 directory\n* `ensure`: can be \"present\", \"installed\", or \"absent\"\n* `require`: if set, this will require that a package of the given name exists\nbefore evaluating the rest of the site definition.  It does not currently\nremove the package, even if ensure is set to absent.\n* `content`: set this to the text of the site definition -- eg, through \ntemplate().  If unset, the module will simply ensure that a file named \n\"/etc/apache2/sites-available/$name\" exists\n\n## Example ##\n\nSee the code for the apache2_debian subclass for an example of how to use\nthis module.\n\n## To Do ##\n\n* apache2::{module,config,site} should really be native types.\n* The configuration of apache2::basic is essentially arbitrary, based on \nwhat I needed to override at the moment.

    "Name": "gurgitate-mail",
    "Readme": "NAME\n    gurgitate-mail - an easy-to-use mail filter\n\nSYNOPSIS\n    gurgitate-mail [-s SENDER] [-f RULESFILE] [-h]\n\nDESCRIPTION\n    \"gurgitate-mail\" is a program which reads your mail and filters it\n    according to the .gurgitate-rules.rb file in your home directory. The\n    configuration file uses Ruby syntax and is thus quite flexible.\n\n    It's generally invoked either through your .forward file:\n\n        \"|/path/to/gurgitate-mail\"\n\n    Or through your .procmailrc file:\n\n        :0:\n        | /path/to/gurgitate-mail\n\n    Alternatively, if you're the sysadmin at your site, or your sysadmin is\n    friendly, you can use gurgitate-mail as a local delivery agent. For\n    postfix, put\n\n        mailbox_command=/opt/bin/gurgitate-mail\n\n    in /etc/postfix/main.cf. If you use any other MTA, and configure\n    gurgitate-mail as a local delivery agent, please tell me how! I want to\n    include this in the documentation.\n\nCOMMAND LINE OPTIONS\n    gurgitate-mail lets you alter its default behaviour with some\n    command-line flags:\n\n    -s SENDER\n         Sets the envelope sender to SENDER.\n\n    -f RULESFILE\n         Uses RULESFILE as the source for gurgitate-rules rather than the\n         default /$HOME/.gurgitate-rules.\n\n    -h   Outputs a quick summary of the options available.\n\nCONFIGURATION FILES\n    There are three configuration files used by gurgitate-mail: two are\n    system-wide, and the third, is the user rules file.\n\n    The two system-wide configuration files are /etc/gurgitate-rules and\n    /etc/gurgitate-rules-default. These are processed before and after the\n    user rules, respectively.\n\n    /etc/gurgitate-rules is used to handle system-wide filtering needs:\n    setting the default mailbox style to Maildir rather than the default\n    MBox, setting the spool directory, things like that.\n\n    The user configuration file is $HOME/.gurgitate-rules (or,\n    alternatively, $HOME/.gurgitate-rules.rb. Either work). You put your own\n    rules here. If the user configuration file doesn't encounter a \"return\"\n    during processing, then the additional rules contained in\n    /etc/gurgitate-rules-default are run. If that also doesn't return, then\n    mail messages are saved into the default mail spool location.\n\n    If the \"-f\" option is used on the commandline, then the file specified\n    will be used and the default rules will not. The \"-f\" option can be used\n    more than once:\n\n        gurgitate-mail -f test-rules -f additional-rules\n\nCONFIGURATION PARAMETERS\n    There are several parameters that you can set to change the way that\n    gurgitate-mail behaves. You set a config parameter by saying, for\n    instance:\n\n        sendmail \"/usr/sbin/sendmail\"\n\n    which sets the \"sendmail\" parameter to \"/usr/sbin/sendmail\".\n\n    maildir\n         The directory you want to put mail folders into. This defaults to\n         $HOME/Mail.\n\n    logfile\n         Where you went gurgitate-mail's log messages to go to. The standard\n         location for this is $HOME/.gurgitate.log\n\n    sendmail\n         The full path to the sendmail program, used to deliver mail. This\n         can be any program that takes as its parameters the list of\n         addresses to deliver mail to, and that takes a mail message on\n         standard input.\n\n    homedir\n         The full path of your home directory. This defaults to whatever\n         your actual home directory is.\n\n    spooldir\n         The path where the system's mail spools goes to. This defaults to\n         \"/var/spool/mail\". On a Maildir system, this should be set to the\n         same as \"homedir\".\n\n    spoolfile\n         The mail spool file component of the full path of your mail spool.\n         This is generally your username. Maildir users should set this to\n         \"Maildir\".\n\n    folderstyle\n         The style of folders you prefer. This can be (at the moment) either\n         MBox or Maildir.\n\nFILTER RULES\n    The filter rules are a series of Ruby statements, with the following\n    methods and variables available:\n\n  Variables\n    from This contains the envelope \"from\" address of the email message.\n         (Note that this isn't necessarily the same as the contents of the\n         \"From:\" header)\n\n    headers\n         This is an object containing the headers of the message. There are\n         several methods that come with this object:\n\n    body This contains the body of the email message. As of yet, there's\n         nothing really interesting which you can do with this, apart from\n         assigning to it; you can rewrite the body of an email message this\n         way. Dealing with attachments is planned for a future release of\n         \"gurgitate-mail\".\n\n    maildir\n         The directory which contains the folders, used by the \"save\" method\n         when you specify a folder as \"=folder\" (like Elm). Defaults to\n         \"$HOME/Mail\".\n\n    homedir\n         Your home directory. Read-only.\n\n    logfile\n         The location of the \"gurgitate-mail\" logfile. If set to \"nil\", then\n         no logging is done. Defaults to \"$HOME/.gurgitate.log\".\n\n    sendmail\n         The location of the \"sendmail\" program. Used by the \"forward\"\n         method. Defaults to \"/usr/lib/sendmail\".\n\n    spoolfile\n         The location of the mail spool. Read-only.\n\n  Methods\n    matches(name(s),regex)\n         Returns \"true\" if the header \"name\" matches the regular expression\n         \"regex\". If \"name\" is an array of header names, then it returns\n         true if at least one of the headers matches. Useful for testing\n         whether both \"To:\" and \"Cc:\" headers match.\n\n    from Returns the envelope \"from\" address of the email message. Note that\n         this is the same as the bare \"from\".\n\n    to   Returns a HeaderBag (a kind of array) with the contents of the \"To\"\n         and the \"Cc\" headers.\n\n    to_s As per Ruby convention, returns all the headers as a \"String\"\n         object.\n\n    save(mailbox)\n         This saves the message to a mailbox. You can specify the mailbox as\n         a word with an = sign in front of it, in which case it puts it into\n         \"maildir\". If you don't use the =name format, then you need to\n         specify an absolute pathname. If it can't write the message to the\n         file you request it to, it'll attempt to write it to \"spoolfile\".\n\n    forward(address)\n         This forwards the email message to another email address.\n\n    pipe(program)\n         This pipes the message through \"program\". \"pipe\" returns the exit\n         code of the program that the message was piped through.\n\n    filter(program)\n         This pipes the message through \"program\" and returns a new\n         Gurgitate object containing the filtered mail. (This is handy for\n         external filters which modify email like, for example,\n         SpamAssassin, which adds a spam-score header.)\n\n         You can also say\n\n             filter(program) do\n                 # code here\n             end\n\n         and it yields the newly-created Gurgitate object to the block.\n\n    headers\n         This returns the headers as an object of their own. This object has\n         its own methods:\n\n         headers[*headernames]\n              This returns a HeaderBag (a subclass of array) containing the\n              headers you asked for. You can then use the =~ operator on\n              this result to match the RHS regex with everything in the\n              HeaderBag.\n\n              You can change a header's value with \"headers[name]=newvalue\".\n\n         headers.match(name,regex)\n              Matches the header with the name \"name\" against the regex.\n              This is the same as headers[name] =~ /regex/.\n\n         headers.matches(names,regex)\n              Matches the headers with the names \"names\" against the regex.\n              This is the same as headers[*names] =~ /regex/.\n\n         headers.from\n              Returns the envelope from. You can change this with\n              \"headers.from=newaddress\" too.\n\n    return\n         This tells \"gurgitate-mail\" to stop processing the email message.\n         If you don't use \"return\", then \"gurgitate-mail\" will continue\n         processing the same mail again with the next rule. If there isn't a\n         \"return\" at the end of gurgitate-rules.rb, then \"gurgitate-mail\"\n         will save the email message in the normal mail spool.\n\n    log(message)\n         This writes a log message to the log file.\n\nSIMPLE EXAMPLES\n    Here are some examples of \"gurgitate-mail\" rules, with explanations:\n\n        if from =~ /ebay.com/ then save(\"=ebay\"); return; end\n\n    Any email from eBay (automatic end-of-auction notifications, for\n    example, and outbid notices) gets filed into the \"ebay\" folder.\n\n        if from =~ /root@/ then save(\"=root\"); return; end\n\n    Any email from root (at any host) gets filed into a special folder.\n    Useful for sysadmins monitoring crontab email.\n\n        if headers.matches([\"To\",\"Cc\"],\"webmaster@\") then\n            save(\"=webmaster\")\n            return\n        end\n\n    Any email with a To: or Cc: line of \"sysadmin\" is saved to a \"sysadmin\"\n    folder. Useful for people with multiple role accounts redirected to\n    their address.\n\n        if headers[\"Subject\"] =~ /\\[SPAM\\]/ then\n            save(\"=spam\")\n            return\n        end\n\n    This is a different syntax for matching patterns against headers. You\n    can also match multiple headers in the square brackets.\n\n        if headers[\"Subject\",\"Keywords\"] =~ /a bad word/ then\n            save(\"=swearing\")\n            return\n        end\n\n    Searches for \"a bad word\" in the Subject and Keywords headers, and if\n    it's there, saves the email in the \"swearing\" folder.\n\n        if headers.matches([\"To\",\"Cc\"],\"mailing-list@example.com\") then\n            pipe(\"rcvstore +mailing-list\")\n            return\n        end\n\n    Any email to a mailing list is piped through \"rcvstore\" to store it into\n    an MH folder.\n\n    That\n\n        headers.matches([\"To\",\"Cc\"],/regex/)\n\n    idiom happens often enough that there's a shorthand for it:\n\n        if to =~ /mailing-list@example.com/ then\n            pipe(\"rcvstore +mailing-list\")\n            return\n        end\n\n    Pipes the mail to the mailing list through \"rcvstore\".\n\nADVANCED EXAMPLES\n    Here are some slightly more clever examples to give you an idea of what\n    you can do with \"gurgitate-mail\". Let's suppose you have an email\n    whitelist in a file called $HOME/.friends, so you can determine whether\n    some email is likely to be spam or not.\n\n    Then if someone on your whitelist sends you email, then you\n    automatically save that into the \"inbox\" folder:\n\n        friends=homedir+\"/.friends\"\n        if FileTest.exists?(friends) and FileTest.readable?(friends) then\n            File.new(friends).each do |friend|\n                if from =~ friend.chomp then\n                    log \"Mail from friend \"+friend.chomp\n                    save(\"=inbox\")\n                    return\n                end\n            end\n        end\n\n    Okay, if someone sends you email, and it's addressed specifically to you\n    (and gurgitate-mail hasn't caught it in another form already), then it\n    might or might not be spam: put it into a \"grey\" folder:\n\n        my_addresses= [ /me@example\\.com/i,\n                        /me@example\\.org/i,\n                        /me@example\\.net/i];  # I have three email addresses\n        my_addresses.each do |addr|\n            if headers.matches([\"To\",\"Cc\"],addr) then\n                save(\"=possibly-not-spam\")\n                return\n            end\n        end\n\n    And after that, if it's not from someone you know, and it's not\n    addressed to your email address either, then it's probably save to\n    assume that it's spam:\n\n        save(\"=spam\")\n        return\n\n    This can be improved by using a Bayesian filter, though; for example,\n    Eric Raymond's bogofilter program (http://bogofilter.sourceforge.net)\n    can be automatically trained and used with the help of the\n    white/grey/black distinctions. Taking the example above, I'll adjust it\n    by adding in calls to bogofilter:\n\n        friends=homedir+\"/.friends\"\n        if FileTest.exists?(friends) and FileTest.readable?(friends) then\n            File.new(friends).each do |friend|\n                if from =~ friend.chomp then\n                    log \"Mail from friend \"+friend.chomp\n                    pipe(\"bogofilter -h\")  # <-- LINE ADDED HERE\n                    save(\"=inbox\")\n                    return\n                end\n            end\n        end\n\n    \"bogofilter -h\" trains bogofilter that mail from whitelisted-people is\n    not to be considered spam. Okay, at the end of the .gurgitate-rules,\n    change\n\n        save(\"=spam\")\n        return\n\n    to\n\n        save(\"=spam\")\n        pipe(\"bogofilter -s\")\n        return\n\n    This trains \"bogofilter\" that anything which doesn't pass the rest of\n    the filter should be considered spam. Now for the interesting bit:\n    Change the bit between these to use \"bogofilter\" to decide whether email\n    is to be considered spam or not:\n\n        my_addresses= [ /me@example\\.com/i,\n                        /me@example\\.org/i,\n                        /me@example\\.net/i];  # I have three email addresses\n        my_addresses.each do |addr|\n            if headers.matches([\"To\",\"Cc\"],addr) then\n                if pipe(\"bogofilter\")==1\n                then\n                    log(\"bogofilter suspects it might not be spam\")\n                    save(\"=possibly-not-spam\")\n                else\n                    log(\"bogofilter thinks it's probably spam\")\n                    save(\"=spam\")\n                end\n                return\n            end\n        end\n\n    \"bogofilter\" has an exit code of \"1\" if it thinks the message is not\n    spam, and \"0\" if it thinks the message is spam.\n\n    Hopefully this should give you an idea of the kinds of things that you\n    can use \"bogofilter\" for.\n\nAUTHOR\n    Dave Brown <gurgitate-mail@dagbrown.com>\n\n\n",

    "Readme": "= SWX Ruby 0.7\n\nPrimary Repo: http://github.com/meekish/swxruby\n\n=== What is SWX?\n\nSWX is the native data format for the Flash Platform.\n\nSWX RPC is a remote procedure call protocol encoded in SWX and a viable alternative to XML and Flash Remoting. It's simple enough that you can get up and running with it in about five minutes. SWX RPC is perfect for building mashups (with easy-to-use APIs for Flickr, Twitter, and others), mobile applications (Flash Lite 2.0 and 2.1), and other data-driven Flash sites and applications. Official web site at http://swxformat.org\n\n=== What is SWX Ruby?\n\nSWX Ruby is the Ruby implementation of SWX RPC. It allows Rubyists to leverage their Ruby skills to build data-driven Flash applications using the wonderfully simple SWX data format. The current beta version assembles AVM1 SWF files (compatible with Flash 8 and below). By its 1.0 release, SWX Ruby will also assemble AVM2 SWF files. Official web site at http://swxruby.org\n\n=== Installation\n\n==== Gem\n\ngem install swxruby\n\n  Note: The SWX Ruby gem declares 'json_pure' as a dependency. json_pure\n  is the pure Ruby variant of the JSON gem. If you have a C compiler and \n  would like better performance then do 'gem install json'\n\n==== Rails plugin\n\nAfter installing the gem, do:\n\n  swxruby --rails PATH_TO_ROOT_OF_YOUR_RAILS_APP\n\nThis will unpack a plugin into your Rails app. For further explanation of the files installed, see 'Rails Usage' below.\n\n<b>Living on the Edge:</b> The Rails init script (init.rb) sits in the root of the SWX Ruby tree, thus you can simply throw the git HEAD into vendor/plugins/swxruby to run the plugin on edge.\n\n  git clone git://github.com/meekish/swxruby.git vendor/plugins/swxruby\n  ruby vendor/plugins/swxruby/install.rb\n\n=== Gem Usage (For Merb, Camping, Sinatra, et al.)\n\nRequire the SWX Ruby gem\n\n  require 'rubygems'\n  require 'swxruby'\n\nDefine a service class in the SwxServiceClasses namespace\n\n  module SwxServiceClasses\n    class Simple\n      def echo_data(data)\n        data\n      end\n    end\n  end\n\nStart making calls to SwxGateway#process\n\n  @swx_bytecode = SwxGateway.process(:serviceClass => 'Simple', :method => 'echo_data', :args => 'Hello World!', :debug => true)\n  # => Returns a binary string of SWX bytecode containing the result of SwxServiceClasses::Simple.new.echo_data('Hello World!')\n\nUse your framework's preferred method to wrap the swx bytecode in a file shell and send it on its way. Here's how Rails and Merb do it:\n\n  send_data(@swx_bytecode, :filename => 'data.swf', :type => 'application/swf', :disposition => 'inline')\n\n==== Example of Gem Usage\n\nHere's a full Merb app (this and a Flash client are included in examples/standalone/)  \n\n  # standalone.rb\n\n  require 'rubygems'\n  require 'swxruby'\n\n  # Service Class\n  class SwxServiceClasses::HelloMerb\n    def just_say_the_words\n      'Hello from Merb!'\n    end\n  end\n\n  # Merb Application\n  Merb::Router.prepare { |r| r.match('/').to(:controller => 'swx_ruby', :action =>'gateway') }\n\n  class SwxRuby < Merb::Controller\n    def gateway\n      send_data(SwxGateway.process(params), :filename => 'data.swf', :type => 'application/swf', :disposition => 'inline')\n    end\n  end\n\n  # Fire it up with 'merb -I standalone.rb' and you're off!\n\n=== Rails Plugin Usage\n\nWhen running as a Rails plugin, SWX Ruby will look for your service classes in\nRAILS_ROOT/app/services. Simply create standard Ruby classes and drop them\nin this folder. SWX Ruby will instantiate your service class (while forcing\nit into the SwxServiceClasses namespace), call the specified method, and\nsend the response back to the Flash Player.\n\nTake a peek at services/hello_world.rb for a working service class example.\nAlright, alright, I'll just show it to you here:\n\n  # hello_world.rb----------------------------------------\n  # Class and method names follow standard Ruby convention\n  class HelloWorld\n    # Service class methods are instance methods.\n    def just_say_the_words\n        'Hello World!'\n    end\n  end\n  #-------------------------------------------------------\n\nHere's an example to call HelloWorld#just_say_the_words from Flash \n(place a MovieClip on stage with an instance name of 'loader' and\nfire up your Rails development server):\n\n  //------------------------------------------------------\n  loader.serviceClass = \"HelloWorld\";\n  // Method names follow ActionScript convention \n  // (converted to underscored server-side)\n  loader.method = \"justSayTheWords\";\n  loader.debug = true;\n  loader.loadMovie(\"http://localhost:3000/swx\", \"POST\");\n\n  function onEnterFrame() {\n   // Will output 'Hello World!' once the SWX file is loaded.\n   trace(loader.result);\n  }\n  //------------------------------------------------------\n\nWhen you're ready for some robust ActionScriptery, head to \nhttp://swxformat.org/download to grab the SWX ActionScript library.\n\nOh yeah, you may return ActiveRecord objects from your service classes; \nSWX Ruby will happily serialize them for you. Go ahead, give it a try!\n\nNOTE: You may notice some Security Sandbox Violations when testing the example\nabove in the Flash IDE. Rest assured, this is OK. Visit \nhttp://swxformat.org/132 for further explanation.\n\n=== Get In Touch\n\nPlease post bug reports/suggestions to http://groups.google.com/group/swxruby\n\n\n",

    "Readme": "= Gibberish\n\nYet another localization library.  Maybe with the most agreeable API?\n\n= Usage\n\nIt's simple.  Your default language, by default, is English (:en).\n\n  >> \"Hey there!\"[:hey]\n  => \"Hey there!\"\n\nGibberish looks in RAILS_ROOT/lang/*.yml for translation files.  Say you have RAILS_ROOT/lang/es.yml, \nright?  Gibberish will detect that you know about the :es language and will serve up translations\ndefined in that file if requested to do so.\n\nHere's a real simple example file (it's just \"key: translation\"):\n\n  $ cat lang/es.yml\n  hey: \u00a1Hey all\u00ed!\n\nAnd, as follows, a real simple example session:\n\n  >> \"Hey there!\"[:hey]\n  => \"Hey there!\"\n  >> Gibberish.current_language\n  => :en\n  >> Gibberish.current_language = :es\n  => :es\n  >> \"Hey there!\"[:hey]\n  => \"\u00a1Hey all\u00ed!\"\n  >> Gibberish.current_language = nil\n  => nil\n  >> \"Hey there!\"[:hey]\n  => \"Hey there!\"\n\nIt even works with simple interpolation:\n\n  >> \"Hey, {name}!\"[:hey_name, 'Chris']   \n  => \"Hey, Chris!\"\n  >> \"{name} is from {place}\"[:hey_place, 'Chris', 'the Dreamworld']\n  => \"Chris is from the Dreamworld\"\n\nNotice we don't use hashes (#) like normal Ruby interpolation.  Also, the names of the variables\nin the brackets don't really mean much.  Interpolation is done in order -- the first argument replaces\nthe first variable in brackets, the second the second, etc.\n\nInterpolation can also be done via hash:\n\n  >> \"{name} is from {place}\"[:hey_place, { :place => 'Gotham City', :name => 'Batman' }]\n  => \"Batman is from Gotham City\"\n\nThis of course works with your translations:\n\n  $ cat lang/es.yml\n  hey: \u00a1Hey all\u00ed!\n  hey_name: \u00a1Hola {name}!\n\n  >> \"Hey, {name}!\"[:hey_name, 'Chris']   \n  => \"Hey, Chris!\"\n  >> Gibberish.current_language = :es\n  => :es\n  >> \"Hey, {name}!\"[:hey_name, 'Crist\u00f3bal']   \n  => \u00a1Hola Crist\u00f3bal!\n\nNeat.  What other methods do we get?\n\nThe classic around_filter:\n\n  class ApplicationController < ActionController::Base\n    around_filter :set_language\n\n  private\n    def set_language\n      Gibberish.use_language(session[:language]) { yield }\n    end\n  end\n\nFor the duration of the block, :es is set as the language of choice.  After the block is run everything\nreturns to normal.  Rad.\n\nFinally, some checking methods, if you need them:\n\n  >> Gibberish.default_language?\n  => true\n  >> Gibberish.current_language = :es\n  => :es\n  >> Gibberish.current_language \n  => :es\n  >> Gibberish.default_language?\n  => false\n\nLanguages are loaded by default at Rails startup.  In dev mode, language YAML files are reloaded when\nmodified.  No need to reboot the server.\n\n  >> Gibberish.load_languages!\n  => [:es, :fr, :de, :kl]\n  >> Gibberish.languages\n  => [:es, :fr, :de, :kl]\n\nMore as it's needed.\n\n= Warning\n\nBy default, Ruby returns nil when a symbol is passed to String's [] method.  Some of Rails, it seems, depends\non this behavior.  Yes, I am changing !!core Ruby behavior!!  The humanity!\n\nTo deal with this assumption, Gibberish has a reserved_keys array.  It, by default, contains :limit (so Rails\nmigrations don't explode on you.)  To add to this array, just pass it more keys:\n\n  >> Gibberish.add_reserved_key :another_key\n  => [:limit, :another_key]\n  >> Gibberish.add_reserved_keys :more, :keys\n  => [:limit, :another_key, :more, :keys]\n\nYou've been warned.  It really shouldn't affect you, though.\n\n>> Chris Wanstrath\n=> chris[at]ozmm[dot]org\n\n",

    "Readme": "= Webrat - Ruby Acceptance Testing for Web applications\n\n  http://rubyforge.org/projects/webrat\n  http://github.com/brynary/webrat\n\n* mailto:bryan@brynary.com\n* mailto:seth@mojodna.net\n\n== DESCRIPTION:\n\nWebrat lets you quickly write robust and thorough acceptance tests for a Ruby\nweb application. By leveraging the DOM, it can run tests similarly to an\nin-browser testing solution without the associated performance hit (and\nbrowser dependency). The result is tests that are less fragile and more\neffective at verifying that the app will respond properly to users.\n\nWhen comparing Webrat with an in-browser testing solution like Watir or\nSelenium, the primary consideration should be how much JavaScript the\napplication uses. In-browser testing is currently the only way to test JS, and\nthat may make it a requirement for your project. If JavaScript is not central\nto your application, Webrat is a simpler, effective solution that will let you\nrun your tests much faster and more frequently. (Benchmarks forthcoming.)\n\nInitial development was sponsored by EastMedia (http://www.eastmedia.com).\n\n== SYNOPSIS:\n\n  def test_sign_up\n    visits \"/\"\n    clicks_link \"Sign up\"\n    fills_in \"Email\", :with => \"good@example.com\"\n    selects \"Free account\"\n    clicks_button \"Register\"\n    ...\n  end\n\nBehind the scenes, this will perform the following work:\n\n1. Verify that loading the home page is successful\n2. Verify that a \"Sign up\" link exists on the home page\n3. Verify that loading the URL pointed to by the \"Sign up\" link leads to a\n   successful page\n4. Verify that there is an \"Email\" input field on the Sign Up page\n5. Verify that there is an select field on the Sign Up page with an option for\n   \"Free account\"\n6. Verify that there is a \"Register\" submit button on the page\n7. Verify that submitting the Sign Up form with the values \"good@example.com\"\n   and \"Free account\" leads to a successful page\n\nTake special note of the things _not_ specified in that test, that might cause\ntests to break unnecessarily as your application evolves:\n\n* The input field IDs or names (e.g. \"user_email\" or \"user[email]\"), which\n  could change if you rename a model\n* The ID of the form element (Webrat can do a good job of guessing, even if\n  there are multiple forms on the page.)\n* The URLs of links followed\n* The URL the form submission should be sent to, which could change if you\n  adjust your routes or controllers\n* The HTTP method for the login request\n\nA test written with Webrat can handle these changes smoothly.\n\n== REQUIREMENTS:\n\n* Rails >= 1.2.6\n* Hpricot >= 0.6\n* Rails integration tests in Test::Unit _or_\n* RSpec stories (using an RSpec version >= revision 2997)\n\n== INSTALL:\n\nIn your stories/helper.rb:\n\n  require \"webrat\"\n\nYou could also unpack the gem into vendor/plugins.\n\n== HISTORY:\n\nSee CHANGELOG in this directory.\n\n== LICENSE:\n\nCopyright (c) 2007 Bryan Helmkamp, Seth Fitzsimmons.\nSee MIT-LICENSE in this directory.\n\n",

To use a mode on  a\nspecific attribute simply pass it in as an options hash after any\nattributes you don't want to mode-ify.  Like so:\nclass Story < ActiveRecord::Base\n  acts_as_textiled :body_text, :description => :lite_mode\nend\nOr:\nclass Story < ActiveRecord::Base\n  acts_as_textiled :body_text => :lite_mode, :description => :lite_mode\nend\nYou can also pass in multiple modes per attribute:\nclass Story < ActiveRecord::Base\n  acts_as_textiled :body_text, :description => [ :lite_mode, :no_span_caps ]\nend\nGet it?  Now let's say you have an admin tool and you want the text to\nbe displayed in the text boxes / fields as plaintext.  Do you have to\nchange all your views?\nHell no.\nform_for\nAre you using form_for?  If you are, you don't have to change any code\nat all.\n<% form_for :story, @story do |f| %>\n  Description: <br/> <%= f.text_field :description %>\n<% end %>\nYou'll see the Textile plaintext in the text field.  It Just Works.\nform tags\nIf you're being a bit unconvential, no worries.  You can still get at\nyour  raw Textile like so:\nDescription: <br/> <%= text_field_tag :description, @story.description(:source) %>\nAnd there's always object.textiled = false, as demo'd above.\nPre-fetching\nacts_as_textiled locally caches rendered HTML once the attribute in\nquestion has  been requested.  Obviously this doesn't bode well for\nmarshalling or caching.\nIf you need to force your object to build and cache HTML for all textiled\nattributes, call the textilize method on your object.\nIf you're real crazy you can even do something like this:\nclass Story < ActiveRecord::Base\n  acts_as_textiled :body_text, :description\n\n  def after_find\n    textilize\n  end\nend\nAll your Textile will now be ready to go in spiffy HTML format.

    "Readme": "FixtureScenariosBuilder\n=======================\n\nThis plugin is an add-on to the FixtureScenarios plugin by Tom Preston-Werner.\nFixtureScenarios is required for this plugin to work.\n\nFixtureScenarios\n  Info: http://code.google.com/p/fixture-scenarios/\n  SVN : http://fixture-scenarios.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/fixture_scenarios\n\nThis plugin\n  Info: http://errtheblog.com/post/7708\n  SVN : svn://errtheblog.com/svn/plugins/fixture_scenarios_builder\n  Bugs: http://err.lighthouseapp.com/projects/466-plugins/tickets/new\n\n== The Setup\n\nYou may, from time to time, wish to build your fixtures entirely in Ruby.\nDoing so has its advantages, such as automatically created join tables\nand default attributes.  YAML files, however, bring with them some real\nnice features in Rails which are difficult to abandon: transactional fixtures, \ntable_name(:key) helpers, and auto-clearing between tests.  How does one get \nthe best of both worlds?\n\n== The Download\n\nUsing the +scenario+ method within <tt>scenarios.rb</tt> file,\nFixtureScenariosBuilder can create your YAML fixture scenarios automatically\nat run time from Ruby-created fixtures.\n\nCreate a <tt>scenarios.rb</tt> file and place it in the root \"fixtures\"\ndirectory:\n\n  [RAILS_ROOT]\n  +-test/\n    +-fixtures/\n      +-scenarios.rb\n\nNow build your scenarios in this file, wrapping scenarios in the \n+scenario+ method and providing it with the name of your scenario.  \nA brief example of a complete <tt>scenarios.rb</tt> file:\n\n  scenario :banned_users do\n    %w( Tom Chris Kevin ).each_with_index do |user, index|\n      User.create(:name => user, :banned => index.odd?)\n    end\n  end\n\nAssuming +banned+ is a boolean field, this will create for us (when our tests\nare first run) the following:\n\n  [RAILS_ROOT]\n  +-test/\n    +-fixtures/\n      +-banned_users/\n        +-users.yml\n\nOur generated <tt>users.yml</tt> file will look something like this:\n\n  chris: \n    name: Chris\n    id: \"2\"\n    banned: \"1\"\n    updated_at: 2007-05-09 09:08:04\n    created_at: 2007-05-09 09:08:04\n  kevin: \n    name: Kevin\n    id: \"3\"\n    banned: \"0\"\n    updated_at: 2007-05-09 09:08:04\n    created_at: 2007-05-09 09:08:04\n  tom: \n    name: Tom\n    id: \"1\"\n    banned: \"0\"\n    updated_at: 2007-05-09 09:08:04\n    created_at: 2007-05-09 09:08:04\n\nNotice how the keys correspond to the user names.  FixtureScenariosBuilder will try,\nto an extent, to guess the name of your key.  If it can't figure it out,\nkeys will be the standard user_001, user_002, etc format.\n\nThanks to Paul Cantrell's handywork, custom key names are supported. Simply use the\n+name+ method:\n\n  scenario :foo do\n    name \"small_red_widget\", Widget.create(:size => 'small', :color => 'red')\n    name \"big_blue_widget\",  Widget.create(:size => 'big',   :color => 'blue')\n  end\n\nAnother option is to assign your records to instance variables, then call +names_from_ivars+\nat the conclusion of your +scenario+ block.\n\n  scenario :foo do\n    @small_red_widget = Widget.create(:size => 'small', :color => 'red')\n    @big_blue_widget  = Widget.create(:size => 'big',   :color => 'blue')\n\n   names_from_ivars!\n  end\n\nThe above produces the following YAML:\n\n  small_red_widget:\n    size: small\n    color: red\n    updated_at: 2007-12-27 10:09:05\n    created_at: 2007-12-27 10:09:05\n  big_blue_widget:\n    size: big\n    color: blue\n    updated_at: 2007-12-27 10:19:23\n    created_at: 2007-12-27 10:19:23\n\nOn subsequent test runs this YAML file will not be needlessly re-created.  YAML\nfiles will only be re-generated when the <tt>scenarios.rb</tt> file is \nmodified.\n\nIf you for some reason need to force your scenarios to rebuild, pass in the\nREBUILD_FIXTURES environment variables:\n\n  $ rake test:units REBUILD_FIXTURES=true\n\nScenarios can also be nested using the familiar Rake-style dependency declaration.\n\n  scenario :users do\n    %w( Tom Chris ).each do |user|\n      User.create(:name => user)\n    end\n  end\n\n  scenario :banned_users => :users do\n    User.create(:name => 'Kevin', :banned => true)\n  end\n\n== Rake\n\nFixtureScenariosBuilder comes with one Rake task, `db:scenario:build' -- use it to\nattempt to build your scenarios on demand.\n\n== Bugs!\n\nPlease report bugs here: http://err.lighthouseapp.com/projects/466-plugins/tickets\n\n>> Chris Wanstrath\n=> chris[at]ozmm[dot]org\n\n",

    "Readme": "F L O O T E R B U C K !\n\n-- What Flooterbuck does\n\nFlooterbuck is an Infobot.  It goes onto IRC and sits in a channel that you\npick for it, and learns, remembers, and gives back useful information.\n\n<dagbrown> flooterbuck, convert 3 tonnes to nautical elvis\n<flooterbuck> dagbrown: 3 tonnes is 22.5341 nautical elvis.\n<dagbrown> flooterbuck: My hair is wet\n<flooterbuck> dagbrown: Okay.\n<dagbrown> flooterbuck, what is a Norse?\n<flooterbuck> dagbrown: A Norse is a Norse, of course, of course\n\n-- Note:  Flooterbuck Infobot vs. Infobot\n\nFlooterbuck Infobot (http://flooterbuck.sf.net/) is a rewrite of\nKevin Lenzo's (apparently abandoned) Infobot (http://www.infobot.org/).\nFlooterbuck is meant to be cleaner, more modular, and more hackable than\nthe original Infobot.\n\nThe authors of Flooterbuck Infobot believe that all of the old Infobot\nfunctionality has been preserved.  However, it is still recommended that\nyou keep your old installations of Infobot around, just in case you find\nthat there is something necessary which only exists in the old Infobot\n(and in that case, please contact the authors of Flooterbuck).\n\nTheoretically, you can copy all of the .db files and the conf/*.config\nfiles from your old Infobot installations into your Flooterbuck installation\nand it will work.  However, you may not get all of the new features of\nFlooterbuck that way -- you should at least have a look at the sample\nconfiguration file included with Flooterbuck to see if there's any new\nfeatures that you want to enable.\n\nFor more information on the differences between Flooterbuck and\nInfobot, please see the REVISIONS files.\n\n\n\n-- Very minimal setup instructions\n\nYou will need to update your infobot.config\nand infobot.users.  See the example files.\n\nThis requires perl 5.\n\nYou should be able to start up just by running\ninfobot.  If you are using macperl, you will\n(currently) have to make one minor change (because\n$^O didn't work for me under os8).\n\nThe infobot uses parameter files, typically in the\nparams directory, to set up with.  It treats anything\non the command line as a parameter file and tries to\nload it.\n\nIf you are using macperl, you will want to set\nthe value of the macperl parameter to 1 in the\ntwo given param files (in the 'files' dir).\n\nBy default, the infobot uses the IRC setup.  This\nmay change.  NOTE that the irc version has no output\nby default; you'll have to turn up the debug level\nto get more.\n\nto start up the infobot, just invoke it from the\ncommand line.\n\n   infobot\n\n\n\n-- A note on forms\n\nYou can prepend the tag <reply>\nto values in the db to just get a reply with no\nextra info.\n\ne.g.\n\n   x => <reply> y\n\nthen when you ask 'x?' it will just reply 'y' instead\nof something like \"i think x is y\".\n\n\n\n\n-- Extending the bot by adding your own code\n\nYou can place your module in the modules directory.  It needs to define a\npackage with the same name as the file itself (without the .pm extension).  It\nneeds to define a subroutine named scan() that takes a callback function, a\nmessage, and the nick of the person who wrote that message.\n\nThe callback function is the function which, when called with an\nargument, will reply to the query in the appropriate way.  That is,\nif the query was originally a private message, the callback function\nwill reply via private message.  If the query was a message in a\nchannel, the callback function will send the reply to the correct\nchannel.\n\nIf the module does not \"catch\" a message, then scan() function should\nreturn undef to allow the message to \"fall through\" to other modules.\n\nThe best way to figure all this out is to look at one of the many modules\nprovided as a reference.\n\nOh, and if the module you added would be of interest to other Flooterbuck\nusers, you might want to consider contributing that code to the project.\nFlooterbuck can be found on Sourceforge at http://flooterbuck.sf.net/\n\n\n\n-- Disabling features of the bot\n\nNearly everything that Flooterbuck does (beside the actual communication\nwith the IRC server) is handled by the modules in the modules directory.\nAlthough some modules can be enabled or disabled by changing the configuration\nfiles, you can disable any module by simply deleting it or moving it to\na different directory.\n\n\n\n-- update_db & dump_db\n\nupdate_db is a little perl script that will take a\nflat ascii file and make an infobot-style db out\nof it (currently just a couple of dbm files). You'll\nwant to make 2, even if theye contain only 1 element\neach.  it will also simply add (and overwrite entries\nin) existing dbs.  This is especially nice if\nyou don't allow updates to the databases through IRC\nand just want a collection of permanent factoids.\n\nupdate_db <inputfile> <dbname>\n\nwhere <inputfile> is an ascii file like (in the case\nof an url-style infobot):\n\ninfobot => at http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~lenzo/hocus.html\n\none key => value per line.  In the current setup,\nyou need an is-database and an are-database, mainly\nfor legacy reasons about representing plurality and\nbeing able to give the proper form.  in the infobot-is.txt\nfile and infobot-are.txt files you have examples.  these\nare a fine starting point:\n\n1.1  update_db infobot-is.txt infobot-is\n     update_db infobot-are.txt infobot-are\n\n2. Now you need to edit infobot to set up your bot.\n   Don't forget to set the path to perl properly at\n   the top and make it executable.\n\n3. Then try running infobot.  At present, there's a\n   bunch of VERY BAD code in it, so don't use the -w\n   switch unless you want to fix a bunch of things and\n   mail me.\n\nEventually, kill it and then you'll probably\nwant to crontab it.  included is a sample crontab\nand the script that you will need to edit.\n\ndump_db <dbname>\n\nwill just make a flat ascii file out of the named db,\ne.g.\n\n   dump_db infobot-is\n\nBoth update_db and dump_db take an optional switch, -m, which tells them\nwhat DBM module to use.  You'll need to specify this if you set\nDBMModule in your config file in order to get the bot to use something\nother than Perl's default.  Eg,\n\n   update_db -m DB_File infobot-is.txt infobot-is\n   dump_db   -m DB_File infobot-is\n\ngood luck, and mail me!\n\nkevin\nlenzo@cs.cmu.edu\n\nps - i am just releasing this _now_ instead of waiting\n     to fix everything.  If you use this and like it,\n     or even if you don't, please mail me!\n\n\n\n-- Thanks to:\n\nKevin Lenzo and his team for the original Infobot.\n\n\n\n",

    "Name": "timetrackr",
    "Readme": "== Welcome to Rails\n\nRails is a web-application and persistence framework that includes everything\nneeded to create database-backed web-applications according to the\nModel-View-Control pattern of separation. This pattern splits the view (also\ncalled the presentation) into \"dumb\" templates that are primarily responsible\nfor inserting pre-built data in between HTML tags. The model contains the\n\"smart\" domain objects (such as Account, Product, Person, Post) that holds all\nthe business logic and knows how to persist themselves to a database. The\ncontroller handles the incoming requests (such as Save New Account, Update\nProduct, Show Post) by manipulating the model and directing data to the view.\n\nIn Rails, the model is handled by what's called an object-relational mapping\nlayer entitled Active Record. This layer allows you to present the data from\ndatabase rows as objects and embellish these data objects with business logic\nmethods. You can read more about Active Record in\nlink:files/vendor/rails/activerecord/README.html.\n\nThe controller and view are handled by the Action Pack, which handles both\nlayers by its two parts: Action View and Action Controller. These two layers\nare bundled in a single package due to their heavy interdependence. This is\nunlike the relationship between the Active Record and Action Pack that is much\nmore separate. Each of these packages can be used independently outside of\nRails.  You can read more about Action Pack in\nlink:files/vendor/rails/actionpack/README.html.\n\n\n== Getting started\n\n1. At the command prompt, start a new rails application using the rails command\n   and your application name. Ex: rails myapp\n   (If you've downloaded rails in a complete tgz or zip, this step is already done)\n2. Change directory into myapp and start the web server: <tt>script/server</tt> (run with --help for options)\n3. Go to http://localhost:3000/ and get \"Welcome aboard: You\u2019re riding the Rails!\"\n4. Follow the guidelines to start developing your application\n\n\n== Web Servers\n\nBy default, Rails will try to use Mongrel and lighttpd if they are installed, otherwise\nRails will use the WEBrick, the webserver that ships with Ruby. When you run script/server,\nRails will check if Mongrel exists, then lighttpd and finally fall back to WEBrick. This ensures\nthat you can always get up and running quickly.\n\nMongrel is a Ruby-based webserver with a C-component (which requires compilation) that is\nsuitable for development and deployment of Rails applications. If you have Ruby Gems installed,\ngetting up and running with mongrel is as easy as: <tt>gem install mongrel</tt>.\nMore info at: http://mongrel.rubyforge.org\n\nIf Mongrel is not installed, Rails will look for lighttpd. It's considerably faster than\nMongrel and WEBrick and also suited for production use, but requires additional\ninstallation and currently only works well on OS X/Unix (Windows users are encouraged\nto start with Mongrel). We recommend version 1.4.11 and higher. You can download it from\nhttp://www.lighttpd.net.\n\nAnd finally, if neither Mongrel or lighttpd are installed, Rails will use the built-in Ruby\nweb server, WEBrick. WEBrick is a small Ruby web server suitable for development, but not\nfor production.\n\nBut of course its also possible to run Rails on any platform that supports FCGI.\nApache, LiteSpeed, IIS are just a few. For more information on FCGI,\nplease visit: http://wiki.rubyonrails.com/rails/pages/FastCGI\n\n\n== Debugging Rails\n\nHave \"tail -f\" commands running on the server.log and development.log. Rails will\nautomatically display debugging and runtime information to these files. Debugging\ninfo will also be shown in the browser on requests from 127.0.0.1.\n\n\n== Debugger\n\nDebugger support is available through the debugger command when you start your Mongrel or\nWebrick server with --debugger. This means that you can break out of execution at any point in the code, investigate\nand change the model, AND then resume execution! Example:\n\n  class WeblogController < ActionController::Base\n    def index\n      @posts = Post.find(:all)\n      debugger\n    end\n  end\n\nSo the controller will accept the action, run the first line, then present you\nwith a IRB prompt in the server window. Here you can do things like:\n\n  >> @posts.inspect\n  => \"[#<Post:0x14a6be8 @attributes={\\\"title\\\"=>nil, \\\"body\\\"=>nil, \\\"id\\\"=>\\\"1\\\"}>,\n       #<Post:0x14a6620 @attributes={\\\"title\\\"=>\\\"Rails you know!\\\", \\\"body\\\"=>\\\"Only ten..\\\", \\\"id\\\"=>\\\"2\\\"}>]\"\n  >> @posts.first.title = \"hello from a debugger\"\n  => \"hello from a debugger\"\n\n...and even better is that you can examine how your runtime objects actually work:\n\n  >> f = @posts.first\n  => #<Post:0x13630c4 @attributes={\"title\"=>nil, \"body\"=>nil, \"id\"=>\"1\"}>\n  >> f.\n  Display all 152 possibilities? (y or n)\n\nFinally, when you're ready to resume execution, you enter \"cont\"\n\n\n== Console\n\nYou can interact with the domain model by starting the console through <tt>script/console</tt>.\nHere you'll have all parts of the application configured, just like it is when the\napplication is running. You can inspect domain models, change values, and save to the\ndatabase. Starting the script without arguments will launch it in the development environment.\nPassing an argument will specify a different environment, like <tt>script/console production</tt>.\n\nTo reload your controllers and models after launching the console run <tt>reload!</tt>\n\nTo reload your controllers and models after launching the console run <tt>reload!</tt>\n\n\n\n== Description of contents\n\napp\n  Holds all the code that's specific to this particular application.\n\napp/controllers\n  Holds controllers that should be named like weblogs_controller.rb for\n  automated URL mapping.

    "Readme": "\nqrencoder\nby Jacob Harris\nhttp://www.nimblecode.com/\nhttp://nycrb.rubyforge.org/qrencoder\nDESCRIPTION:\nThis Gem is a wrapper around an useful open-source library for creating QR\nCodes, a two-dimensional bar code format popular in Japan (and readable by\ncell phones even) created by the Denso-Wave Corporation in 1994. These bar\ncodes look like the following:\n\nThe specification for QR Code is readable at www.denso-wave.com/qrcode/index-e.html.\nQR Code is not the only 2-D barcode standard in existence, and it is in\nwider use in Japan than elsewhere. Notable competitors include PDF417,\nSemacode/DataMatrix, and Maxi Code (seen on UPS labels) in North America;\nShotCode in the UK; and an additional format used in Korea. All vary in\nlook and capacity, but QR Code has one of the largest information densities\nand capacities among them with the following maximum data\n\nNumeric 7,089\n\nAlphanumeric 4,296\n\n8-Bit 2,953\n\nKanji 1,817\n\nAll of these in a square that may range from 21 to 177 pixels a side (there\nare 40 different \u201cversions\u201d of the code that specify different sizes). In\naddition, multiple levels of error correction are possible which might also\ninfluence the final size.\nUSAGE:\nBasic usage is as follows:\ntext = \"Some string\"\nqrcode = QREncoder.encode(text) #=> #<QREncoder::QRCode:0x1003710d0>\nputs \"#{qrcode.version}\"  #=> 7\nputs \"#{qrcode.width}\"    #=> 34\nqrcode.save_png(\"/tmp/foo.png\")\nYou can retrieve the pixels of the QR Code object directly or use the\nincluded methods to save a PNG file directly.\nSee the rdocs for\noptions you can pass to QREncoder#encode.\nREQUIREMENTS:\nThis gem requires you to build the C library lib 111qrcode.a\navailable from megaui.net/fukuchi/works/qrencode/index.en.html.\nOn *nix systems, installation is usually as simple as:\ncurl http://fukuchi.org/works/qrencode/qrencode-3.2.0.tar.gz | tar xz\ncd qrencode-3.2.0\n./configure\nmake\nsudo make install\nIf it worked, you should be able to type qrencode and get a help\nmessage.\nNormally, the build process also expects you to have libpng, but\nthis is only used for the qrenc command-line utility and can be\navoided if you run the following build sequence:\n./configure --without-tools\nmake\nsudo make install\nHOMEBREW:\nIf you're on OS X, you can use homebrew to install libqrencode:\nbrew install qrencode\nINSTALLATION:\n\nFirst build the libqrencode library following the instructions\nabove.\n\nThen [sudo] gem install qrencoder\n\nDEVELOPMENT AND CONTRIBUTING:\nThis project uses Bundler and its own gemspec for dependency management. To\nget started, just clone the repo and run:\ngem install bundler\nbundle install\nrake\nThe default Rake task will compile the C component and run the specs. If it\nfails to build, make sure that you have libqrencode installed properly.\nPlease send pull requests. Topic branches are preferred. New features will\nnot be accepted without corresponding tests.\nFEATURES/PROBLEMS:\n\nThis gem requires you to build and install an external C library\n\nThe QREncode lib this GEM is built around is only thread-safe from version\n3.2.0 onwards!\n\nCONTRIBUTORS:\n\nJacob Harris (harrisj)\n\nJoshua Davey (jgdavey)\n\nJoseph Holsten\n\nWesley Moore (wezm)\n\nQRCODE LICENSE:\nThe QR Code specification was created and patented by the Denso Corporation\nof Japan.

Amazon sdb is a different type of database:\n\n* Accessed over the network via RESTful calls\n* No schemas or types\n* Each SimpleDB account can have up to 100 domains for data.\n* Domains can hold objects referenced by unique keys\n* Each object can hold up to 256 name/value attributes.\n* Only name/value pairs must be unique in an objects attributes, there can be multiple name/value attributes with the same name.\n* In addition to key-driven accessors, objects can also be searched with a basic query language.\n* All value are stored as strings and comparisons use lexical order. Thus, it is necessary to pad integers and floats with 0s and save dates in ISO 8601 format for query comparisons to work\n\n== FEATURES:\n\n* A basic interface to Amazon SimpleDB\n* Includes a class for representing attribute sets in SimpleDB\n* Automatic conversion to/from SimpleDB representations for integers and dates (for floats, it's suggested you use the Multimap#numeric function)\n* The beginnings of mock-based tests for methods derived from Amazon's docs\n\n== CAVEATS\n\n* Not all features are tested yet (sorry!)\n* Amazon has not actually opened up access to the 2007-11-07 API on which this gem is based (and my tests are for). Some things may work differently in real life.\n* Errors still need to be figured out / tested.\n* I don't process the data usage/costs info from Amazon yet.\n\n== FUTURE WORK:\n\n* Some sort of fake SQL-esque query language\n* Some sort of AR/Datamapper/Ambition connection layer fun (with schema overlays)\n\n== SYNOPSIS:\n\n  b = Amazon::SDB::Base.new(aws_public_key, aws_secret_key)\n    b.domains #=> list of domain\n    domain = b.create_domain 'my domain'\n\n    m = Multimap.new {:first_name => \"Jacob\", :last_name => \"Harris\"}\n    domain.put_attributes \"Jacob Harris\", m\n    resultset = domain.query \"['first_name' begins-with 'Harris']\"\n\n== REQUIREMENTS:\n\n* An Amazon Web Services account\n* hpricot\n\n== INSTALL:\n\n* sudo gem install amazon_sdb\n\n== LICENSE:\n\n(The MIT License)\n\nCopyright (c) 2007 FIX\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining\na copy of this software and associated documentation files (the\n'Software'), to deal in the Software without restriction, including\nwithout limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish,\ndistribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to\npermit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to\nthe following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be\nincluded in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED 'AS IS', WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,\nEXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF\nMERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.\nIN NO EVENT SHALL THE AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY\nCLAIM, DAMAGES OR OTHER LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT,\nTORT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM, OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE\nSOFTWARE OR THE USE OR OTHER DEALINGS IN THE SOFTWARE.\n\n",

    "Readme": "== Welcome to Rails\n\nRails is a web-application framework that includes everything needed to create \ndatabase-backed web applications according to the Model-View-Control pattern. \n\nThis pattern splits the view (also called the presentation) into \"dumb\" templates\nthat are primarily responsible for inserting pre-built data in between HTML tags.\nThe model contains the \"smart\" domain objects (such as Account, Product, Person,\nPost) that holds all the business logic and knows how to persist themselves to\na database. The controller handles the incoming requests (such as Save New Account,\nUpdate Product, Show Post) by manipulating the model and directing data to the view.\n\nIn Rails, the model is handled by what's called an object-relational mapping\nlayer entitled Active Record. This layer allows you to present the data from\ndatabase rows as objects and embellish these data objects with business logic\nmethods. You can read more about Active Record in\nlink:files/vendor/rails/activerecord/README.html.\n\nThe controller and view are handled by the Action Pack, which handles both\nlayers by its two parts: Action View and Action Controller. These two layers\nare bundled in a single package due to their heavy interdependence. This is\nunlike the relationship between the Active Record and Action Pack that is much\nmore separate. Each of these packages can be used independently outside of\nRails.  You can read more about Action Pack in\nlink:files/vendor/rails/actionpack/README.html.\n\n\n== Getting Started\n\n1. At the command prompt, start a new Rails application using the <tt>rails</tt> command\n   and your application name. Ex: rails myapp\n2. Change directory into myapp and start the web server: <tt>script/server</tt> (run with --help for options)\n3. Go to http://localhost:3000/ and get \"Welcome aboard: You're riding the Rails!\"\n4. Follow the guidelines to start developing your application\n\n\n== Web Servers\n\nBy default, Rails will try to use Mongrel and lighttpd if they are installed, otherwise\nRails will use WEBrick, the webserver that ships with Ruby. When you run script/server,\nRails will check if Mongrel exists, then lighttpd and finally fall back to WEBrick. This ensures\nthat you can always get up and running quickly.\n\nMongrel is a Ruby-based webserver with a C component (which requires compilation) that is\nsuitable for development and deployment of Rails applications. If you have Ruby Gems installed,\ngetting up and running with mongrel is as easy as: <tt>gem install mongrel</tt>.\nMore info at: http://mongrel.rubyforge.org\n\nIf Mongrel is not installed, Rails will look for lighttpd. It's considerably faster than\nMongrel and WEBrick and also suited for production use, but requires additional\ninstallation and currently only works well on OS X/Unix (Windows users are encouraged\nto start with Mongrel). We recommend version 1.4.11 and higher. You can download it from\nhttp://www.lighttpd.net.\n\nAnd finally, if neither Mongrel or lighttpd are installed, Rails will use the built-in Ruby\nweb server, WEBrick. WEBrick is a small Ruby web server suitable for development, but not\nfor production.\n\nBut of course its also possible to run Rails on any platform that supports FCGI.\nApache, LiteSpeed, IIS are just a few. For more information on FCGI,\nplease visit: http://wiki.rubyonrails.com/rails/pages/FastCGI\n\n\n== Apache .htaccess example\n\n# General Apache options\nAddHandler fastcgi-script .fcgi\nAddHandler cgi-script .cgi\nOptions +FollowSymLinks +ExecCGI\n\n# If you don't want Rails to look in certain directories,\n# use the following rewrite rules so that Apache won't rewrite certain requests\n# \n# Example:\n#   RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} ^/notrails.*\n#   RewriteRule .* - [L]\n\n# Redirect all requests not available on the filesystem to Rails\n# By default the cgi dispatcher is used which is very slow\n# \n# For better performance replace the dispatcher with the fastcgi one\n#\n# Example:\n#   RewriteRule ^(.*)$ dispatch.fcgi [QSA,L]\nRewriteEngine On\n\n# If your Rails application is accessed via an Alias directive,\n# then you MUST also set the RewriteBase in this htaccess file.\n#\n# Example:\n#   Alias /myrailsapp /path/to/myrailsapp/public\n#   RewriteBase /myrailsapp\n\nRewriteRule ^$ index.html [QSA]\nRewriteRule ^([^.]+)$ $1.html [QSA]\nRewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f\nRewriteRule ^(.*)$ dispatch.cgi [QSA,L]\n\n# In case Rails experiences terminal errors\n# Instead of displaying this message you can supply a file here which will be rendered instead\n# \n# Example:\n#   ErrorDocument 500 /500.html\n\nErrorDocument 500 \"<h2>Application error</h2>Rails application failed to start properly\"\n\n\n== Debugging Rails\n\nSometimes your application goes wrong.  Fortunately there are a lot of tools that\nwill help you debug it and get it back on the rails.\n\nFirst area to check is the application log files.  Have \"tail -f\" commands running\non the server.log and development.log. Rails will automatically display debugging\nand runtime information to these files. Debugging info will also be shown in the\nbrowser on requests from 127.0.0.1.\n\nYou can also log your own messages directly into the log file from your code using\nthe Ruby logger class from inside your controllers. Example:\n\n  class WeblogController < ActionController::Base\n    def destroy\n      @weblog = Weblog.find(params[:id])\n      @weblog.destroy\n      logger.info(\"#{Time.now} Destroyed Weblog ID ##{@weblog.id}!\")\n    end\n  end\n\nThe result will be a message in your log file along the lines of:\n\n  Mon Oct 08 14:22:29 +1000 2007 Destroyed Weblog ID #1\n\nMore information on how to use the logger is at http://www.ruby-doc.org/core/\n\nAlso, Ruby documentation can be found at http://www.ruby-lang.org/ including:\n\n* The Learning Ruby (Pickaxe) Book: http://www.ruby-doc.org/docs/ProgrammingRuby/\n* Learn to Program: http://pine.fm/LearnToProgram/  (a beginners guide)\n\nThese two online (and free) books will bring you up to speed on the Ruby language\nand also on programming in general.\n\n\n== Debugger\n\nDebugger support is available through the debugger command when you start your Mongrel or\nWebrick server with --debugger. This means that you can break out of execution at any point\nin the code, investigate and change the model, AND then resume execution! \nYou need to install ruby-debug to run the server in debugging mode. With gems, use 'gem install ruby-debug'\nExample:\n\n  class WeblogController < ActionController::Base\n    def index\n      @posts = Post.find(:all)\n      debugger\n    end\n  end\n\nSo the controller will accept the action, run the first line, then present you\nwith a IRB prompt in the server window. Here you can do things like:\n\n  >> @posts.inspect\n  => \"[#<Post:0x14a6be8 @attributes={\\\"title\\\"=>nil, \\\"body\\\"=>nil, \\\"id\\\"=>\\\"1\\\"}>,\n       #<Post:0x14a6620 @attributes={\\\"title\\\"=>\\\"Rails you know!\\\", \\\"body\\\"=>\\\"Only ten..\\\", \\\"id\\\"=>\\\"2\\\"}>]\"\n  >> @posts.first.title = \"hello from a debugger\"\n  => \"hello from a debugger\"\n\n...and even better is that you can examine how your runtime objects actually work:\n\n  >> f = @posts.first\n  => #<Post:0x13630c4 @attributes={\"title\"=>nil, \"body\"=>nil, \"id\"=>\"1\"}>\n  >> f.\n  Display all 152 possibilities? (y or n)\n\nFinally, when you're ready to resume execution, you enter \"cont\"\n\n\n== Console\n\nYou can interact with the domain model by starting the console through <tt>script/console</tt>.\nHere you'll have all parts of the application configured, just like it is when the\napplication is running. You can inspect domain models, change values, and save to the\ndatabase. Starting the script without arguments will launch it in the development environment.\nPassing an argument will specify a different environment, like <tt>script/console production</tt>.\n\nTo reload your controllers and models after launching the console run <tt>reload!</tt>\n\n== dbconsole\n\nYou can go to the command line of your database directly through <tt>script/dbconsole</tt>.\nYou would be connected to the database with the credentials defined in database.yml.\nStarting the script without arguments will connect you to the development database. Passing an\nargument will connect you to a different database, like <tt>script/dbconsole production</tt>.\nCurrently works for mysql, postgresql and sqlite.\n\n== Description of Contents\n\napp\n  Holds all the code that's specific to this particular application.\n\napp/controllers\n  Holds controllers that should be named like weblogs_controller.rb for\n  automated URL mapping. All controllers should descend from ApplicationController\n  which itself descends from ActionController::Base.\n\napp/models\n  Holds models that should be named like post.rb.\n  Most models will descend from ActiveRecord::Base.\n\napp/views\n  Holds the template files for the view that should be named like\n  weblogs/index.html.erb for the WeblogsController#index action. All views use eRuby\n  syntax.\n\napp/views/layouts\n  Holds the template files for layouts to be used with views. This models the common\n  header/footer method of wrapping views. In your views, define a layout using the\n  <tt>layout :default</tt> and create a file named default.html.erb. Inside default.html.erb,\n  call <% yield %> to render the view using this layout.\n\napp/helpers\n  Holds view helpers that should be named like weblogs_helper.rb. These are generated\n  for you automatically when using script/generate for controllers. Helpers can be used to\n  wrap functionality for your views into methods.\n\nconfig\n  Configuration files for the Rails environment, the routing map, the database, and other dependencies.\n\ndb\n  Contains the database schema in schema.rb.  db/migrate contains all\n  the sequence of Migrations for your schema.\n\ndoc\n  This directory is where your application documentation will be stored when generated\n  using <tt>rake doc:app</tt>\n\nlib\n  Application specific libraries. Basically, any kind of custom code that doesn't\n  belong under controllers, models, or helpers. This directory is in the load path.\n\npublic\n  The directory available for the web server. Contains subdirectories for images, stylesheets,\n  and javascripts. Also contains the dispatchers and the default HTML files. This should be\n  set as the DOCUMENT_ROOT of your web server.\n\nscript\n  Helper scripts for automation and generation.\n\ntest\n  Unit and functional tests along with fixtures. When using the script/generate scripts, template\n  test files will be generated for you and placed in this directory.\n\nvendor\n  External libraries that the application depends on. Also includes the plugins subdirectory.\n  If the app has frozen rails, those gems also go here, under vendor/rails/.\n  This directory is in the load path.\n\n",

    "Name": "piston",
    "Readme": "Piston is a utility that eases vendor branch management.\nThis is similar to <tt>svn:externals</tt>, except you have a local copy of\nthe files, which you can modify at will.  As long as the changes are\nmergeable, you should have no problems.\n\nPiston is Ruby 1.9.1 compatible.\n\nThis tool has a similar purpose than svnmerge.py which you can find in the\ncontrib/client-side folder of the main Subversion repository at\nhttp://svn.collab.net/repos/svn/trunk/contrib/client-side/svnmerge.py.\nThe main difference is that Piston is designed to work with remote\nrepositories.  Another tool you might want to look at, SVK, which you can find\nat http://svk.elixus.org/.\n\nFrom Wikipedia's Piston page (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piston):\n  In general, a piston is a sliding plug that fits closely inside the bore\n  of a cylinder.\n\n  Its purpose is either to change the volume enclosed by the cylinder, or\n  to exert a force on a fluid inside the cylinder.\n\nFor this utility, I retain the second meaning, \"to exert a force on a fluid\ninside the cylinder.\"  Piston forces the content of a remote repository\nlocation back into our own.\n\n\n= Notes on 2.0\n\nIn the 1.0 era, Piston was exclusively geared towards Subversion repositories.\nIn early 2008, Git gained a lot of popularity among Ruby and Rails coders.\nPiston was rewritten during that period to allow many repositories and working\ncopies to be used together.\n\nThe documentation still refers to Subversion throughout, but 2.0 allows any\nrepository to be used with any working copy.\n\n\n= Installation\n\nNothing could be simpler:\n\n $ gem install piston\n\n\n= Usage\n\nFirst, you need to import the remote repository location:\n\n $ piston import http://dev.rubyonrails.org/svn/rails/trunk vendor/rails\n Exported r4720 from 'http://dev.rubyonrails.org/svn/rails/trunk' to 'vendor/rails'\n\n $ svn commit -m \"Importing local copy of Rails\"\n\nWhen you want to get the latest changes from the remote repository location:\n\n $ piston update vendor/rails\n Updated 'vendor/rails' to r4720.\n\n $ svn commit -m \"Updates vendor/rails to the latest revision\"\n\nYou can prevent a local Piston-managed folder from updating by using the\n+lock+ subcommand:\n\n $ piston lock vendor/rails\n 'vendor/rails' locked at r4720.\n\nWhen you want to update again, you unlock:\n\n $ piston unlock vendor/rails\n 'vendor/rails' unlocked.\n\nIf the branch you are following moves, you should use the switch subcommand:\n\n $ piston import http://dev.rubyonrails.org/svn/rails/branches/1-2-pre-release vendor/rails\n $ svn commit vendor/rails\n\n # Vendor branch is renamed, let's follow it\n $ piston switch http://dev.rubyonrails.org/svn/rails/branches/1-2-stable vendor/rails\n\n\n= Contributions\n\n== Bash Shell Completion Script\n\nMichael Schuerig contributed a Bash shell completion script.  You should copy\n+contrib/piston+ from your gem repository to the appropriate folder.  Michael\nsaid:\n\n  I've put together a bash completion function for piston. On Debian, I\n  just put it in /etc/bash_completion.d, alternatively, the contents can\n  be copied to ~/.bash_completion. I don't know how things are organized\n  on other Unix/Linux systems.\n\n\n= Caveats\n\n== Speed\n\nThis tool is SLOW.  The update process particularly so.  I use a brute force\napproach.  Subversion cannot merge from remote repositories, so instead I\ncheckout the folder at the initial revision, and then run svn update and\nparse the results of that to determine what changes have occured.\n\nIf a local copy of a file was changed, it's changes will be merged back in.\nIf that introduces a conflict, Piston will not detect it.  The commit will be\nrejected by Subversion anyway.\n\n== Copies / Renames\n\nPiston *does not* track copies.  Since Subversion does renames in two\nphases (copy + delete), that is what Piston does.\n\n== Local Operations Only\n\nPiston only works if you have a working copy.  It also never commits your\nworking copy directly.  You are responsible for reviewing the changes and\napplying any pending fixes.\n\n== Remote Repository UUID\n\nPiston caches the remote repository UUID, allowing it to know if the remote\nrepos is still the same.  Piston refuses to work against a different\nrepository than the one we checked out from originally.\n\n\n= Subversion Properties Used\n\n* <tt>piston:uuid</tt>: The remote repository's UUID, which we always confirm\n  before doing any operations.\n* <tt>piston:root</tt>: The repository root URL from which this Piston folder\n  was exported from.\n* <tt>piston:remote-revision</tt>: The <tt>Last Changed Rev</tt> of the remote\n  repository.\n* <tt>piston:local-revision</tt>: The <tt>Last Changed Rev</tt> of the Piston\n  managed folder, to enable us to know if we need to do any merging.\n* <tt>piston:locked</tt>: The revision at which this folder is locked.  If\n  this property is set and non-blank, Piston will skip the folder with\n  an appropriate message.\n\n",

If you run a VPS or dedicated machine like me, then just install them via `sudo gem install`)\n* CRON access\n\n== Description ==\n\nFeedCache will retrieve, cache and store locally a list of RSS feeds that you can then display on your WP site. This prevents multiple HTTP requests with each page load since the feeds can be read from the cache file.\n\n== Installation ==\n\n1. Upload the feedcache directory to your wordpress wp-content/plugins directory. Make sure the feedcache directory is writeable by the web server (rw-rw-rw 666).\n\n2. Change the file permissions on the master-config.txt file to rw-rw-rw- (666)\n\n3. Activate the FeedCache plugin through your wordpress plugin menu\n\n4. Setup FeedCache options under the Options -> FeedCache Options menu\n    (a) Choose the number of feed groups you want (1 - 99)\n  (b) Add your list of RSS feeds 1 per line and set the other options.  You can have up to 4 different groupings of RSS feeds to cache.\n      If you wish to manually override the name of the feed, place a pipe character \"|\" after the RSS URL and then type the name you want to use (e.g http://www.craigjolicoeur.com|Craig P Jolicoeur)\n      If you wish to manually override the number of feed items to display, place a pipe character \"|\" after the feed title and enter the number to display\n      If you wish to manually override the feed text formatting, place a pipe character \"|\" after the feed display number and put either of a true/false boolean value\n  (c) Take note of the \"CRON Script Settings\" section at the bottom - you will need this info\n\n5. Edit the feedcache-cron.rb file\n  (a) Copy the \"feedcache directory\" path from the CRON Script Settings into the \"FEEDCACHE_DIR = ''\" variable\n  (b) Set the number of characters from each RSS feed you want to display\n\n6. Add the feedcache-cron.rb ruby script to your servers CRON job (if you need help with CRON please refer\n   to the following URL: http://www.unixgeeks.org/security/newbie/unix/cron-1.html)\n  (e.g. 30 * * * * /usr/bin/ruby /path/to/your/wordpress/install/wp-content/plugins/feedcache/feedcache-cron.rb)\n\n7. Add the following code to your wordpress theme where you want the RSS feed listing to be displayed\n\n    <?php if (function_exists('feedcache_display_feeds')) { echo feedcache_display_feeds(); } ?>  \n\n    for the default (group 1) listing or you can specify a group (in this case, group 2) \n\n    <?php if (function_exists('feedcache_display_feeds')) { echo feedcache_display_feeds(2); } ?>  \n\n    If you don't specify a group number in the function call, then Group 1 will be used.  If you want to specify the specific\n    group number to display use \"feedcache_display_feeds(_GROUP_NUMBER_)\" where _GROUP_NUMBER_ is the number you want to display.\n\n8. Sit back and enjoy the plugin\n\n\n\n== Upgrading ==\n\n**** IMPORTANT ************************************************************************\n    If you are upgrading from a version of FeedCache prior to v0.9.8, please\n    deactivate and delete your existing feedcache plugin directory and follow the new\n    installation steps.\n***************************************************************************************\n\n1. Deactivate the previous version of FeedCache through your Wordpress plugins menu\n\n2. Upload the new feedcache-cron.rb, feedcache.php and complete lib/ directory files to your existing feedcache directory.  You do not need to overwrite your master-config.txt file.\n\n3. Enter the correct FEEDCACHE_DIR variable in the feedcache-cron.rb script\n\n4. Go to Options -> FeedCache Options and update your FeedCache settings\n\n\n== Frequently Asked Questions ==\n\n= Why would I need this plugin? =\n\nIf you are using your WP installation to display other website's RSS feeds, this will save HTTP requests and improve page load times for your users.  By using a CRON job to fetch and format the feeds, the user will not have to wait during page load for the feed to be updated.\n\n= Will FeedCache work with Atom feeds? = \n\nYes!  FeedCache will work with both RSS and ATOM feeds.\n\n= Can I receive error emails from the CRON process? =\n\nYes, just set CRON_EMAILS = true in the feedcache-cron.rb script.  Error emails are turned off by default.\n\n= Can I have more than 10 RSS Groups = \n\nYes, but you'll need to manually edit the feedcache.php file.  Find the following line:\n\n  define(\"MAX_GROUPSIZE\", 10);\n\nand change the number 10 to whatever number you need.  (Just don't go overboard, :) )  Take note that when you upgrade the\nFeedCache plugin in the future, you'll need to update this number every time.\n\n\n== Screenshots ==\n\n1.

    "Readme": "== Welcome to Rails\n\nRails is a web-application and persistence framework that includes everything\nneeded to create database-backed web-applications according to the\nModel-View-Control pattern of separation. This pattern splits the view (also\ncalled the presentation) into \"dumb\" templates that are primarily responsible\nfor inserting pre-built data in between HTML tags. The model contains the\n\"smart\" domain objects (such as Account, Product, Person, Post) that holds all\nthe business logic and knows how to persist themselves to a database. The\ncontroller handles the incoming requests (such as Save New Account, Update\nProduct, Show Post) by manipulating the model and directing data to the view.\n\nIn Rails, the model is handled by what's called an object-relational mapping\nlayer entitled Active Record. This layer allows you to present the data from\ndatabase rows as objects and embellish these data objects with business logic\nmethods. You can read more about Active Record in\nlink:files/vendor/rails/activerecord/README.html.\n\nThe controller and view are handled by the Action Pack, which handles both\nlayers by its two parts: Action View and Action Controller. These two layers\nare bundled in a single package due to their heavy interdependence. This is\nunlike the relationship between the Active Record and Action Pack that is much\nmore separate. Each of these packages can be used independently outside of\nRails.  You can read more about Action Pack in\nlink:files/vendor/rails/actionpack/README.html.\n\n\n== Getting Started\n\n1. At the command prompt, start a new Rails application using the <tt>rails</tt> command\n   and your application name. Ex: rails myapp\n   (If you've downloaded Rails in a complete tgz or zip, this step is already done)\n2. Change directory into myapp and start the web server: <tt>script/server</tt> (run with --help for options)\n3. Go to http://localhost:3000/ and get \"Welcome aboard: You\u2019re riding the Rails!\"\n4. Follow the guidelines to start developing your application\n\n\n== Web Servers\n\nBy default, Rails will try to use Mongrel and lighttpd if they are installed, otherwise\nRails will use WEBrick, the webserver that ships with Ruby. When you run script/server,\nRails will check if Mongrel exists, then lighttpd and finally fall back to WEBrick. This ensures\nthat you can always get up and running quickly.\n\nMongrel is a Ruby-based webserver with a C component (which requires compilation) that is\nsuitable for development and deployment of Rails applications. If you have Ruby Gems installed,\ngetting up and running with mongrel is as easy as: <tt>gem install mongrel</tt>.\nMore info at: http://mongrel.rubyforge.org\n\nIf Mongrel is not installed, Rails will look for lighttpd. It's considerably faster than\nMongrel and WEBrick and also suited for production use, but requires additional\ninstallation and currently only works well on OS X/Unix (Windows users are encouraged\nto start with Mongrel). We recommend version 1.4.11 and higher. You can download it from\nhttp://www.lighttpd.net.\n\nAnd finally, if neither Mongrel or lighttpd are installed, Rails will use the built-in Ruby\nweb server, WEBrick. WEBrick is a small Ruby web server suitable for development, but not\nfor production.\n\nBut of course its also possible to run Rails on any platform that supports FCGI.\nApache, LiteSpeed, IIS are just a few. For more information on FCGI,\nplease visit: http://wiki.rubyonrails.com/rails/pages/FastCGI\n\n\n== Debugging Rails\n\nSometimes your application goes wrong.  Fortunately there are a lot of tools that\nwill help you debug it and get it back on the rails.\n\nFirst area to check is the application log files.  Have \"tail -f\" commands running\non the server.log and development.log. Rails will automatically display debugging\nand runtime information to these files. Debugging info will also be shown in the\nbrowser on requests from 127.0.0.1.\n\nYou can also log your own messages directly into the log file from your code using\nthe Ruby logger class from inside your controllers. Example:\n\n  class WeblogController < ActionController::Base\n    def destroy\n      @weblog = Weblog.find(params[:id])\n      @weblog.destroy\n      logger.info(\"#{Time.now} Destroyed Weblog ID ##{@weblog.id}!\")\n    end\n  end\n\nThe result will be a message in your log file along the lines of:\n\n  Mon Oct 08 14:22:29 +1000 2007 Destroyed Weblog ID #1\n\nMore information on how to use the logger is at http://www.ruby-doc.org/core/\n\nAlso, Ruby documentation can be found at http://www.ruby-lang.org/ including:\n\n* The Learning Ruby (Pickaxe) Book: http://www.ruby-doc.org/docs/ProgrammingRuby/\n* Learn to Program: http://pine.fm/LearnToProgram/  (a beginners guide)\n\nThese two online (and free) books will bring you up to speed on the Ruby language\nand also on programming in general.\n\n\n== Debugger\n\nDebugger support is available through the debugger command when you start your Mongrel or\nWebrick server with --debugger. This means that you can break out of execution at any point\nin the code, investigate and change the model, AND then resume execution! Example:\n\n  class WeblogController < ActionController::Base\n    def index\n      @posts = Post.find(:all)\n      debugger\n    end\n  end\n\nSo the controller will accept the action, run the first line, then present you\nwith a IRB prompt in the server window. Here you can do things like:\n\n  >> @posts.inspect\n  => \"[#<Post:0x14a6be8 @attributes={\\\"title\\\"=>nil, \\\"body\\\"=>nil, \\\"id\\\"=>\\\"1\\\"}>,\n       #<Post:0x14a6620 @attributes={\\\"title\\\"=>\\\"Rails you know!\\\", \\\"body\\\"=>\\\"Only ten..\\\", \\\"id\\\"=>\\\"2\\\"}>]\"\n  >> @posts.first.title = \"hello from a debugger\"\n  => \"hello from a debugger\"\n\n...and even better is that you can examine how your runtime objects actually work:\n\n  >> f = @posts.first\n  => #<Post:0x13630c4 @attributes={\"title\"=>nil, \"body\"=>nil, \"id\"=>\"1\"}>\n  >> f.\n  Display all 152 possibilities? (y or n)\n\nFinally, when you're ready to resume execution, you enter \"cont\"\n\n\n== Console\n\nYou can interact with the domain model by starting the console through <tt>script/console</tt>.\nHere you'll have all parts of the application configured, just like it is when the\napplication is running. You can inspect domain models, change values, and save to the\ndatabase. Starting the script without arguments will launch it in the development environment.\nPassing an argument will specify a different environment, like <tt>script/console production</tt>.\n\nTo reload your controllers and models after launching the console run <tt>reload!</tt>\n\n\n== Description of Contents\n\napp\n  Holds all the code that's specific to this particular application.\n\napp/controllers\n  Holds controllers that should be named like weblogs_controller.rb for\n  automated URL mapping. All controllers should descend from ApplicationController\n  which itself descends from ActionController::Base.\n\napp/models\n  Holds models that should be named like post.rb.\n  Most models will descend from ActiveRecord::Base.\n\napp/views\n  Holds the template files for the view that should be named like\n  weblogs/index.erb for the WeblogsController#index action. All views use eRuby\n  syntax.\n\napp/views/layouts\n  Holds the template files for layouts to be used with views. This models the common\n  header/footer method of wrapping views. In your views, define a layout using the\n  <tt>layout :default</tt> and create a file named default.erb. Inside default.erb,\n  call <% yield %> to render the view using this layout.\n\napp/helpers\n  Holds view helpers that should be named like weblogs_helper.rb. These are generated\n  for you automatically when using script/generate for controllers. Helpers can be used to\n  wrap functionality for your views into methods.\n\nconfig\n  Configuration files for the Rails environment, the routing map, the database, and other dependencies.\n\ndb\n  Contains the database schema in schema.rb.  db/migrate contains all\n  the sequence of Migrations for your schema.\n\ndoc\n  This directory is where your application documentation will be stored when generated\n  using <tt>rake doc:app</tt>\n\nlib\n  Application specific libraries. Basically, any kind of custom code that doesn't\n  belong under controllers, models, or helpers. This directory is in the load path.\n\npublic\n  The directory available for the web server. Contains subdirectories for images, stylesheets,\n  and javascripts. Also contains the dispatchers and the default HTML files. This should be\n  set as the DOCUMENT_ROOT of your web server.\n\nscript\n  Helper scripts for automation and generation.\n\ntest\n  Unit and functional tests along with fixtures. When using the script/generate scripts, template\n  test files will be generated for you and placed in this directory.\n\nvendor\n  External libraries that the application depends on.

    "Readme": "= SWX Ruby 0.7\n\nPrimary Repo: http://github.com/meekish/swxruby\n\n=== What is SWX?\n\nSWX is the native data format for the Flash Platform.\n\nSWX RPC is a remote procedure call protocol encoded in SWX and a viable alternative to XML and Flash Remoting. It's simple enough that you can get up and running with it in about five minutes. SWX RPC is perfect for building mashups (with easy-to-use APIs for Flickr, Twitter, and others), mobile applications (Flash Lite 2.0 and 2.1), and other data-driven Flash sites and applications. Official web site at http://swxformat.org\n\n=== What is SWX Ruby?\n\nSWX Ruby is the Ruby implementation of SWX RPC. It allows Rubyists to leverage their Ruby skills to build data-driven Flash applications using the wonderfully simple SWX data format. The current beta version assembles AVM1 SWF files (compatible with Flash 8 and below). By its 1.0 release, SWX Ruby will also assemble AVM2 SWF files. Official web site at http://swxruby.org\n\n=== Installation\n\n==== Gem\n\ngem install swxruby\n\n  Note: The SWX Ruby gem declares 'json_pure' as a dependency. json_pure\n  is the pure Ruby variant of the JSON gem. If you have a C compiler and \n  would like better performance then do 'gem install json'\n\n==== Rails plugin\n\nAfter installing the gem, do:\n\n  swxruby --rails PATH_TO_ROOT_OF_YOUR_RAILS_APP\n\nThis will unpack a plugin into your Rails app. For further explanation of the files installed, see 'Rails Usage' below.\n\n<b>Living on the Edge:</b> The Rails init script (init.rb) sits in the root of the SWX Ruby tree, thus you can simply throw the git HEAD into vendor/plugins/swxruby to run the plugin on edge.\n\n  git clone git://github.com/meekish/swxruby.git vendor/plugins/swxruby\n  ruby vendor/plugins/swxruby/install.rb\n\n=== Gem Usage (For Merb, Camping, Sinatra, et al.)\n\nRequire the SWX Ruby gem\n\n  require 'rubygems'\n  require 'swxruby'\n\nDefine a service class in the SwxServiceClasses namespace\n\n  module SwxServiceClasses\n    class Simple\n      def echo_data(data)\n        data\n      end\n    end\n  end\n\nStart making calls to SwxGateway#process\n\n  @swx_bytecode = SwxGateway.process(:serviceClass => 'Simple', :method => 'echo_data', :args => 'Hello World!', :debug => true)\n  # => Returns a binary string of SWX bytecode containing the result of SwxServiceClasses::Simple.new.echo_data('Hello World!')\n\nUse your framework's preferred method to wrap the swx bytecode in a file shell and send it on its way. Here's how Rails and Merb do it:\n\n  send_data(@swx_bytecode, :filename => 'data.swf', :type => 'application/swf')\n\n==== Example of Gem Usage\n\nHere's a full Merb app (this and a Flash client are included in examples/standalone/)  \n\n  # standalone.rb\n\n  require 'rubygems'\n  require 'swxruby'\n\n  # Service Class\n  class SwxServiceClasses::HelloMerb\n    def just_say_the_words\n      'Hello from Merb!'\n    end\n  end\n\n  # Merb Application\n  Merb::Router.prepare { |r| r.match('/').to(:controller => 'swx_ruby', :action =>'gateway') }\n\n  class SwxRuby < Merb::Controller\n    def gateway\n      send_data(SwxGateway.process(params), :filename => 'data.swf', :type => 'application/swf')\n    end\n  end\n\n  # Fire it up with 'merb -I standalone.rb' and you're off!\n\n=== Rails Plugin Usage\n\nWhen running as a Rails plugin, SWX Ruby will look for your service classes in\nRAILS_ROOT/app/services. Simply create standard Ruby classes and drop them\nin this folder. SWX Ruby will instantiate your service class (while forcing\nit into the SwxServiceClasses namespace), call the specified method, and\nsend the response back to the Flash Player.\n\nTake a peek at services/hello_world.rb for a working service class example.\nAlright, alright, I'll just show it to you here:\n\n  # hello_world.rb----------------------------------------\n  # Class and method names follow standard Ruby convention\n  class HelloWorld\n    # Service class methods are instance methods.\n    def just_say_the_words\n        'Hello World!'\n    end\n  end\n  #-------------------------------------------------------\n\nHere's an example to call HelloWorld#just_say_the_words from Flash \n(place a MovieClip on stage with an instance name of 'loader' and\nfire up your Rails development server):\n\n  //------------------------------------------------------\n  loader.serviceClass = \"HelloWorld\";\n  // Method names follow ActionScript convention \n  // (converted to underscored server-side)\n  loader.method = \"justSayTheWords\";\n  loader.debug = true;\n  loader.loadMovie(\"http://localhost:3000/swx\", \"POST\");\n\n  function onEnterFrame() {\n   // Will output 'Hello World!' once the SWX file is loaded.\n   trace(loader.result);\n  }\n  //------------------------------------------------------\n\nWhen you're ready for some robust ActionScriptery, head to \nhttp://swxformat.org/download to grab the SWX ActionScript library.\n\nOh yeah, you may return ActiveRecord objects from your service classes; \nSWX Ruby will happily serialize them for you. Go ahead, give it a try!\n\nNOTE: You may notice some Security Sandbox Violations when testing the example\nabove in the Flash IDE. Rest assured, this is OK. Visit \nhttp://swxformat.org/132 for further explanation.\n\n=== Get In Touch\n\nPlease post bug reports/suggestions to http://groups.google.com/group/swxruby\n\n\n",

For example, if you  have an app running on port 3000, and the\ncallback path is \u201c/\u201d, and the canvas path  is \u201cmyapp\u201d, you would run:\n$ fakebook --callback=\"http://localhost:3000/\" --canvas=\"myapp\"\nSee \u201cfakebook \u2013help\u201d for more options. By default, Fakebook will look for a\nconfig file at  ./config/fakebook.yml. The file should look like this:\ncallback: http://localhost:3000/\ncanvas:   myapp\nsecret:   secret\nuser:     1\nsession:  session_key\nfriends:  2, 3, 4\nhost:     0.0.0.0\nport:     5000\nYou can also use the library directly with the Fakebook class, which eases\ntesting:\nrequire 'fakebook'\napp = Fakebook.new :callback  => \"http://localhost:3000/\",\n                   :canvas    => \"myapp\",\n                   :secret    => \"secret\",\n                   :fb_params => { :user => 1, :session_key => 'session_key', :friends => [2, 3, 4] }\napp.request(\"/\")\nBecause Fakebook implements #call according to the Rack  specification, you\ncan create an HTTP server  that proxies to your application using your\nchoice of server library (Mongrel, WEBrick, Thin,  etc.) For example:\nrequire 'fakebook'\napp = Fakebook.new # etc...\nRack::Handler::Mongrel.run app, :Port => 5000\nGetting started\nTo install via RubyGems:\n$ sudo gem install sco-fakebook --source http://gems.github.com/\nRun the executable to see the available options:\n$ fakebook --help\nTo install the development version from the repository:\n$ wget http://github.com/sco/fakebook/tarball/master\n$ tar -xvf sco-fakebook-master.tar.gz\n$ cd sco-fakebook-master\n$ sudo rake install_gem\nDependencies\nRuby Rack >= 0.3.0\nAuthor\nScott Raymond <sco@scottraymond.net>\nThanks to PackRat, from\nwhich this code was extracted.\n",

(You supply the name of the\n  test case as a query parameter in the application URL.)  It allows\n  you to use your test applet as your debugging scaffolding, without\n  running a lot of code that you aren't interested in.\n\n* <b>Automated test sequencing</b> runs all the test applets in a\n  directory, in series, in a single browser window, stopping if one of\n  them has an error.  It allows you to run all of a package's test\n  cases from the browser by visiting a single url, instead of\n  navigating to each url in turn.\n\n* <b>Behavioral testing</b> implements mocks, stubs, and expectations.\n  It allows you to *test* one class, while *stubbing* the classes that\n  it depends on.  You can even verify that the tested class makes\n  functions thatyou expect it to.  This is a loose port of rspec to\n  OpenLaszlo.\n\n* <b>Asynchronous test support</b> allows you to write a test case\n  that is only considered complete when the callback functions or\n  delegates that it defines return.  If a test case creates a callback\n  function, the test case is only complete when the callback function\n  returns.  (Except if the callback function creates a callback\n  function, etc.)\n\n== Requirements\n\nThis package requires OpenLaszlo 3.4.0 or 4.0.6.  (Other versions\nmight work, but aren't tested.)\n\n== Installation\n\n* Download the latest version from {download-location}.\n\n* Unpack it into your OpenLaszlo webapp directory; for example, at\n  <tt>${OPENLASZLO_HOME}/Server/lps-3.4.0/lztestkit</tt>.\n\n* Visit e.g. http://127.0.0.1:8080/openlaszlo-4.0.6/lztestkit/examples\n  and http://127.0.0.1:8080/openlaszlo-4.0.6/lztestkit/test.

You should be able to click on the examples and tests\n  in order to run them.\n\n== Features\n\n=== Test case selection\n\nIf a test application is compiled with support for test case selection, you\ncan invoke it with a <tt>testCase=<em>{testCaseName}</em></tt> query parameter\nto run only the test case named <em>{testCaseName}</em>.\n\nInclude <tt>lzunit-extensions.js</tt> in your application (or include\n<tt>library.lzx</tt>, which includes this).  Then, include the\ntestCase={testCaseName} query parameter in the URL that you use to\nopen the application, where {testCaseName} is the name of the test\ncase.  Only this test case will execute.\n\nSee the example in <tt>examples/test-selection.lzx</tt>.\n\n=== Automated test sequencing\n\nCopy <tt>test/autorun/index.jsp</tt> into your test directory to run\nall the test applications in that directory within a single browser\nwindow, without user interaction.\n\nCopy <tt>test/autorun/index.jsp</tt> into your test directory, and\nupdate the includes at the top of the file to reflect the paths to the\nlztestkit <tt>src</tt> and <tt>lib</tt> subdirectories.  By default,\nthis file will run files in its directory that match /test-*.lzx/;\nthis is a configuration parameter that it should be obvious how to\nchange.\n\nEach test cases should include <tt>autorun-lz.js</tt> via <script\nsrc=\"autorun-lz.js\"/>.  If you have a <tt>library.lzx</tt> file with\ntest scaffolding, you can place that directive there.\n\n==== Support files\n<tt>autorun-lz.js</tt>:: implements the OpenLaszlo side of automated execution\n<tt>autorun-browser.js</tt>:: implements browser support\n<tt>autorun-include.jsp</tt>:: is a JSP include that embeds the files in the current directory into the generated HTML for the index page\n<tt>jquery-1.2.1.min.js</tt>:: is the jQuery library.  I didn't write this! but the browser support file needs it\n<tt>swfobject.js</tt>:: is the swfobject library.  I didn't write this! but the browser support file needs it\n\n\n=== Behavioral testing\n\nTODO\n\nThis lets you write things like this in a test case:\n\n  myMockObject = Mock.Create(MyClass);\n  myMockObject.mock.expects.aMethod(1, 'arg', {name:2});\n  // call a fn that invokes myMockObject.aMethod(1, 'arg', {name:2})\n  myMockObject.mock.verify();\n\n  myMockObject.stub('aMethod', 'arg1', 'arg2', Function)\n    .by.calling(1);\n  // call a fn that invokes myMockObject.aMethod('arg1', 'arg2', function(n) {...})\n  // and expects the funarg to be called back with n=1\n\n  calling(anObject, 'methodName', 'arg1')\n    .should.call(otherObject, 'method', 'some', 'arguments')\n    .and.send(anObject, 'onchange', 'data')\n    .and.returnWith(1)\n\n  constructing('MyClass', 'initarg')\n    .should.call(otherObject, 'method', 'some', 'arguments')\n\n==== Implementation\n\n<tt>lzmock.js</tt>:: TODO\n<tt>lzspec.js</tt>:: TODO\n<tt>lzunit-extensions.js</tt>:: adds <tt>assertNotEquals</tt>, <tt>assert[Not]Contains</tt>, and <tt>assertFasterThan</tt> methods to <tt>TestCase</tt>\n<tt>jsspec.js</tt>::  js-level support for lzspec (without OpenLaszlo dependencies)\n<tt>hopkit.js</tt>:: support file for jsspec and lzmock\n\n=== Asynchronous test support\n\nTODO\n\nThis features allows lzunit to run asynchronous tests, which are not\ncomplete until a delegate or callback has been called.  A typical\nusage pattern is the following test, which asserts that setTimeout\ndelays at least the requested amount of time:\n\n  <method name=\"testSetTimeout\" args=\"c\">\n    var interval = 1000,\n        startTime = new Date;\n    // c(function(){...}) is equivalent to function(){...}\n    // except that it re-enters the dynamic bindings of the\n    // test case.\n    setTimeout(c(function() {\n      var endTime = new Date;\n      assertTrue(endTime - startTime >= interval);\n    }), interval);\n  </method>\n\nFor now, see <tt>examples/test-lzunit-async.lzx</tt>.  The new methods are\nalso copiously documented in <tt>src/lzunit-async.lzx</tt>.\n\n== Support Files\n\nThe browser support for autorun relies on jQuery and swfobject.  I've\nincluded versions of these in the <tt>src</tt> directory.\n\nThe behavioral testing files use hopkit.js to define chains.\n<tt>hopkit</tt> isn't otherwise ready for general release; and it's\nnot necessary to use this file directly.\n\n== License\n\nLzTestKit is copyright (c) 2007 Oliver Steele.

    "Readme": "== Welcome to Rails\n\nRails is a web-application and persistence framework that includes everything\nneeded to create database-backed web-applications according to the\nModel-View-Control pattern of separation. This pattern splits the view (also\ncalled the presentation) into \"dumb\" templates that are primarily responsible\nfor inserting pre-built data in between HTML tags. The model contains the\n\"smart\" domain objects (such as Account, Product, Person, Post) that holds all\nthe business logic and knows how to persist themselves to a database. The\ncontroller handles the incoming requests (such as Save New Account, Update\nProduct, Show Post) by manipulating the model and directing data to the view.\n\nIn Rails, the model is handled by what's called an object-relational mapping\nlayer entitled Active Record. This layer allows you to present the data from\ndatabase rows as objects and embellish these data objects with business logic\nmethods. You can read more about Active Record in\nlink:files/vendor/rails/activerecord/README.html.\n\nThe controller and view are handled by the Action Pack, which handles both\nlayers by its two parts: Action View and Action Controller. These two layers\nare bundled in a single package due to their heavy interdependence. This is\nunlike the relationship between the Active Record and Action Pack that is much\nmore separate. Each of these packages can be used independently outside of\nRails.  You can read more about Action Pack in\nlink:files/vendor/rails/actionpack/README.html.\n\n\n== Getting Started\n\n1. At the command prompt, start a new Rails application using the <tt>rails</tt> command\n   and your application name. Ex: rails myapp\n   (If you've downloaded Rails in a complete tgz or zip, this step is already done)\n2. Change directory into myapp and start the web server: <tt>script/server</tt> (run with --help for options)\n3. Go to http://localhost:3000/ and get \"Welcome aboard: You\u2019re riding the Rails!\"\n4. Follow the guidelines to start developing your application\n\n\n== Web Servers\n\nBy default, Rails will try to use Mongrel and lighttpd if they are installed, otherwise\nRails will use WEBrick, the webserver that ships with Ruby. When you run script/server,\nRails will check if Mongrel exists, then lighttpd and finally fall back to WEBrick. This ensures\nthat you can always get up and running quickly.\n\nMongrel is a Ruby-based webserver with a C component (which requires compilation) that is\nsuitable for development and deployment of Rails applications. If you have Ruby Gems installed,\ngetting up and running with mongrel is as easy as: <tt>gem install mongrel</tt>.\nMore info at: http://mongrel.rubyforge.org\n\nIf Mongrel is not installed, Rails will look for lighttpd. It's considerably faster than\nMongrel and WEBrick and also suited for production use, but requires additional\ninstallation and currently only works well on OS X/Unix (Windows users are encouraged\nto start with Mongrel). We recommend version 1.4.11 and higher. You can download it from\nhttp://www.lighttpd.net.\n\nAnd finally, if neither Mongrel or lighttpd are installed, Rails will use the built-in Ruby\nweb server, WEBrick. WEBrick is a small Ruby web server suitable for development, but not\nfor production.\n\nBut of course its also possible to run Rails on any platform that supports FCGI.\nApache, LiteSpeed, IIS are just a few. For more information on FCGI,\nplease visit: http://wiki.rubyonrails.com/rails/pages/FastCGI\n\n\n== Debugging Rails\n\nSometimes your application goes wrong.  Fortunately there are a lot of tools that\nwill help you debug it and get it back on the rails.\n\nFirst area to check is the application log files.  Have \"tail -f\" commands running\non the server.log and development.log. Rails will automatically display debugging\nand runtime information to these files. Debugging info will also be shown in the\nbrowser on requests from 127.0.0.1.\n\nYou can also log your own messages directly into the log file from your code using\nthe Ruby logger class from inside your controllers. Example:\n\n  class WeblogController < ActionController::Base\n    def destroy\n      @weblog = Weblog.find(params[:id])\n      @weblog.destroy\n      logger.info(\"#{Time.now} Destroyed Weblog ID ##{@weblog.id}!\")\n    end\n  end\n\nThe result will be a message in your log file along the lines of:\n\n  Mon Oct 08 14:22:29 +1000 2007 Destroyed Weblog ID #1\n\nMore information on how to use the logger is at http://www.ruby-doc.org/core/\n\nAlso, Ruby documentation can be found at http://www.ruby-lang.org/ including:\n\n* The Learning Ruby (Pickaxe) Book: http://www.ruby-doc.org/docs/ProgrammingRuby/\n* Learn to Program: http://pine.fm/LearnToProgram/  (a beginners guide)\n\nThese two online (and free) books will bring you up to speed on the Ruby language\nand also on programming in general.\n\n\n== Debugger\n\nDebugger support is available through the debugger command when you start your Mongrel or\nWebrick server with --debugger. This means that you can break out of execution at any point\nin the code, investigate and change the model, AND then resume execution! Example:\n\n  class WeblogController < ActionController::Base\n    def index\n      @posts = Post.find(:all)\n      debugger\n    end\n  end\n\nSo the controller will accept the action, run the first line, then present you\nwith a IRB prompt in the server window. Here you can do things like:\n\n  >> @posts.inspect\n  => \"[#<Post:0x14a6be8 @attributes={\\\"title\\\"=>nil, \\\"body\\\"=>nil, \\\"id\\\"=>\\\"1\\\"}>,\n       #<Post:0x14a6620 @attributes={\\\"title\\\"=>\\\"Rails you know!\\\", \\\"body\\\"=>\\\"Only ten..\\\", \\\"id\\\"=>\\\"2\\\"}>]\"\n  >> @posts.first.title = \"hello from a debugger\"\n  => \"hello from a debugger\"\n\n...and even better is that you can examine how your runtime objects actually work:\n\n  >> f = @posts.first\n  => #<Post:0x13630c4 @attributes={\"title\"=>nil, \"body\"=>nil, \"id\"=>\"1\"}>\n  >> f.\n  Display all 152 possibilities? (y or n)\n\nFinally, when you're ready to resume execution, you enter \"cont\"\n\n\n== Console\n\nYou can interact with the domain model by starting the console through <tt>script/console</tt>.\nHere you'll have all parts of the application configured, just like it is when the\napplication is running. You can inspect domain models, change values, and save to the\ndatabase. Starting the script without arguments will launch it in the development environment.\nPassing an argument will specify a different environment, like <tt>script/console production</tt>.\n\nTo reload your controllers and models after launching the console run <tt>reload!</tt>\n\n\n== Description of Contents\n\napp\n  Holds all the code that's specific to this particular application.\n\napp/controllers\n  Holds controllers that should be named like weblogs_controller.rb for\n  automated URL mapping. All controllers should descend from ApplicationController\n  which itself descends from ActionController::Base.\n\napp/models\n  Holds models that should be named like post.rb.\n  Most models will descend from ActiveRecord::Base.\n\napp/views\n  Holds the template files for the view that should be named like\n  weblogs/index.erb for the WeblogsController#index action. All views use eRuby\n  syntax.\n\napp/views/layouts\n  Holds the template files for layouts to be used with views. This models the common\n  header/footer method of wrapping views. In your views, define a layout using the\n  <tt>layout :default</tt> and create a file named default.erb. Inside default.erb,\n  call <% yield %> to render the view using this layout.\n\napp/helpers\n  Holds view helpers that should be named like weblogs_helper.rb. These are generated\n  for you automatically when using script/generate for controllers. Helpers can be used to\n  wrap functionality for your views into methods.\n\nconfig\n  Configuration files for the Rails environment, the routing map, the database, and other dependencies.\n\ndb\n  Contains the database schema in schema.rb.  db/migrate contains all\n  the sequence of Migrations for your schema.\n\ndoc\n  This directory is where your application documentation will be stored when generated\n  using <tt>rake doc:app</tt>\n\nlib\n  Application specific libraries. Basically, any kind of custom code that doesn't\n  belong under controllers, models, or helpers. This directory is in the load path.\n\npublic\n  The directory available for the web server. Contains subdirectories for images, stylesheets,\n  and javascripts. Also contains the dispatchers and the default HTML files. This should be\n  set as the DOCUMENT_ROOT of your web server.\n\nscript\n  Helper scripts for automation and generation.\n\ntest\n  Unit and functional tests along with fixtures. When using the script/generate scripts, template\n  test files will be generated for you and placed in this directory.\n\nvendor\n  External libraries that the application depends on.

So a tight \nintegration with C was my highest priority; that ruled and drove the \nimplementation of Nu.  That's why Nu is \"C over lambda.\"\n\nIt is easier to integrate with C when you have a disciplined way of structuring \nC code.  Popular scripting languages (Python, Ruby, Lua, etc.) make many \nimplementation-dependent impositions on the C code that they call.  Their\nartifacts are often called \"glue code\" and are usually ugly, cumbersome, and \nunpleasant to generate.\n\nObjective-C provides a proven way of structuring C code that has no scripting \nlanguage implementation dependencies.  But it can do much more than that.\nObjective-C can also serve as a platform for a powerful dynamic language.  \nNu was designed to take full advantage of that.  It was also designed to \nprovide many of the elements of successful scripting languages, notably \nRuby, while adding the syntactic simplicity and flexibility of Lisp.   \n\nLEGAL\n\nNu is copyrighted open-source software that is released under the Apache\nPublic License, version 2.0.

    "Name": "searchify",
    "Readme": "Searchify\n=========\n\nThis is a Rails plugin which adds some search functionality to models. It also includes a javascript file and helper methods for building a dynamic search form.\n\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\nIf you are running edge rails you can install the plugin straight from the repository:\n\n    script/plugin install git://github.com/ryanb/searchify.git\n\nOtherwise you can install it with this command:\n\n    git clone --depth=1 git://github.com/ryanb/searchify.git vendor/plugins/searchify\n\nTo use the dynamic form you need to install a javascript file using this command:\n\n    script/generate searchify_javascript\n\n\nRequirements\n------------\n\nThis plugin uses the \"paginate\" method to perform a search on the model, so you need to install the will_paginate plugin/gem.\n\nCurrently only MySQL is fully supported. It may work on other database engines, just not as well.\n\n\nInstructions\n------------\n\nYou can use the \"searchify\" method in your model class to enable it for searching. Pass the columns you want to search to this method.\n\n    class Product < ActiveRecord::Base\n      searchify :name, :description, :price, :created_at, :discontinued\n    end\n\nYou can then use the \"search\" method to search all or some of these columns. Here are some examples.\n\n    Product.search(:name => 'Puzzle', :description => '%forest%') # use percent sign for partial search\n    Product.search(:all => 'blue puzzle') # searches for partial word \"blue\" and \"puzzle\" in all columns\n    Product.search(:created_at_from => '2008-01-01', :created_at_to => '2008-02-01')\n    Product.search(:price_operator => '<', :price => '40') # changes the comparison operator\n    Product.search(:page => 5, :per_page => 20, :order => 'name') # pass other options besides conditions\n\nThe searchify also allows you to include associations in the search. For example:\n\n    class Category < ActiveRecord::Base\n      has_many :products\n        searchify :name, :products => [:name, :description]\n    end\n\nTo search the product columns you need to prefix them with \"products_\" like this:\n\n    Category.search(:products_name => 'Big Ben') # finds all categories with a product called Big Ben\n    Category.search(:all => 'puzzle') # product columns are included\n\n\n\nThe main benefit of this plugin is how easy it is to add a dynamic search. You can use the searchify_fields_for helper method to generate dynamic fields for searching. Like this:\n\n    <% form_tag products_path, :method => 'get' do %>\n      <%= searchify_fields_for Product %>\n      <p><%= submit_tag 'Search', :name => nil, :onclick => 'return searchify_submit()' %></p>\n    <% end %>\n\nMake sure you have the prototype libraries included and it should allow you to dynamically add and remove fields. Pretty cool huh?\n\n\n---\n\nCopyright (c) 2008 Ryan Bates, released under the MIT license\n\n",

    "Name": "attachment_fu",
    "Readme": "attachment-fu\n=============\n\nattachment_fu is a plugin by Rick Olson (aka technoweenie <http://techno-weenie.net>) and is the successor to acts_as_attachment.  To get a basic run-through of its capabilities, check out Mike Clark's tutorial <http://clarkware.com/cgi/blosxom/2007/02/24#FileUploadFu>.\n\n\nattachment_fu functionality\n===========================\n\nattachment_fu facilitates file uploads in Ruby on Rails.  There are a few storage options for the actual file data, but the plugin always at a minimum stores metadata for each file in the database.\n\nThere are three storage options for files uploaded through attachment_fu:\n  File system\n  Database file\n  Amazon S3\n\nEach method of storage many options associated with it that will be covered in the following section.  Something to note, however, is that the Amazon S3 storage requires you to modify config/amazon_s3.yml and the Database file storage requires an extra table.\n\n\nattachment_fu models\n====================\n\nFor all three of these storage options a table of metadata is required.  This table will contain information about the file (hence the 'meta') and its location.  This table has no restrictions on naming, unlike the extra table required for database storage, which must have a table name of db_files (and by convention a model of DbFile).\n\nIn the model there are two methods made available by this plugins: has_attachment and validates_as_attachment.\n\nhas_attachment(options = {})\n  This method accepts the options in a hash:\n    :content_type     # Allowed content types.\n                      # Allows all by default.  Use :image to allow all standard image types.\n    :min_size         # Minimum size allowed.\n                      # 1 byte is the default.\n    :max_size         # Maximum size allowed.\n                      # 1.megabyte is the default.\n    :size             # Range of sizes allowed.\n                      # (1..1.megabyte) is the default.  This overrides the :min_size and :max_size options.\n    :resize_to        # Used by RMagick to resize images.\n                      # Pass either an array of width/height, or a geometry string.\n    :thumbnails       # Specifies a set of thumbnails to generate.\n                      # This accepts a hash of filename suffixes and RMagick resizing options.\n                      # This option need only be included if you want thumbnailing.\n    :thumbnail_class  # Set which model class to use for thumbnails.\n                      # This current attachment class is used by default.\n    :path_prefix      # path to store the uploaded files.\n                      # Uses public/#{table_name} by default for the filesystem, and just #{table_name} for the S3 backend.  \n                      # Setting this sets the :storage to :file_system.\n    :storage          # Specifies the storage system to use..\n                      # Defaults to :db_file.  Options are :file_system, :db_file, and :s3.\n    :processor        # Sets the image processor to use for resizing of the attached image.\n                      # Options include ImageScience, Rmagick, and MiniMagick.  Default is whatever is installed.\n\n\n  Examples:\n    has_attachment :max_size => 1.kilobyte\n    has_attachment :size => 1.megabyte..2.megabytes\n    has_attachment :content_type => 'application/pdf'\n    has_attachment :content_type => ['application/pdf', 'application/msword', 'text/plain']\n    has_attachment :content_type => :image, :resize_to => [50,50]\n    has_attachment :content_type => ['application/pdf', :image], :resize_to => 'x50'\n    has_attachment :thumbnails => { :thumb => [50, 50], :geometry => 'x50' }\n    has_attachment :storage => :file_system, :path_prefix => 'public/files'\n    has_attachment :storage => :file_system, :path_prefix => 'public/files', \n                   :content_type => :image, :resize_to => [50,50]\n    has_attachment :storage => :file_system, :path_prefix => 'public/files',\n                   :thumbnails => { :thumb => [50, 50], :geometry => 'x50' }\n    has_attachment :storage => :s3\n\nvalidates_as_attachment\n  This method prevents files outside of the valid range (:min_size to :max_size, or the :size range) from being saved.  It does not however, halt the upload of such files.  They will be uploaded into memory regardless of size before validation.\n\n  Example:\n    validates_as_attachment\n\n\nattachment_fu migrations\n========================\n\nFields for attachment_fu metadata tables...\n  in general:\n    size,         :integer  # file size in bytes\n    content_type, :string   # mime type, ex: application/mp3\n    filename,     :string   # sanitized filename\n  that reference images:\n    height,       :integer  # in pixels\n    width,        :integer  # in pixels\n  that reference images that will be thumbnailed:\n    parent_id,    :integer  # id of parent image (on the same table, a self-referencing foreign-key).\n                            # Only populated if the current object is a thumbnail.\n    thumbnail,    :string   # the 'type' of thumbnail this attachment record describes.  \n                            # Only populated if the current object is a thumbnail.\n                            # Usage:\n                            # [ In Model 'Avatar' ]\n                            #   has_attachment :content_type => :image, \n                            #                  :storage => :file_system, \n                            #                  :max_size => 500.kilobytes,\n                            #                  :resize_to => '320x200>',\n                            #                  :thumbnails => { :small => '10x10>',\n                            #                                   :thumb => '100x100>' }\n                            # [ Elsewhere ]\n                            # @user.avatar.thumbnails.first.thumbnail #=> 'small'\n  that reference files stored in the database (:db_file):\n    db_file_id,   :integer  # id of the file in the database (foreign key)\n\nField for attachment_fu db_files table:\n  data, :binary # binary file data, for use in database file storage\n\n\nattachment_fu views\n===================\n\nThere are two main views tasks that will be directly affected by attachment_fu: upload forms and displaying uploaded images.\n\nThere are two parts of the upload form that differ from typical usage.\n  1. Include ':multipart => true' in the html options of the form_for tag.\n    Example:\n      <% form_for(:attachment_metadata, :url => { :action => \"create\" }, :html => { :multipart => true }) do |form| %>\n\n  2. Use the file_field helper with :uploaded_data as the field name.\n    Example:\n      <%= form.file_field :uploaded_data %>\n\nDisplaying uploaded images is made easy by the public_filename method of the ActiveRecord attachment objects using file system and s3 storage.\n\npublic_filename(thumbnail = nil)\n  Returns the public path to the file.  If a thumbnail prefix is specified it will return the public file path to the corresponding thumbnail.\n  Examples:\n    attachment_obj.public_filename          #=> /attachments/2/file.jpg\n    attachment_obj.public_filename(:thumb)  #=> /attachments/2/file_thumb.jpg\n    attachment_obj.public_filename(:small)  #=> /attachments/2/file_small.jpg\n\nWhen serving files from database storage, doing more than simply downloading the file is beyond the scope of this document.\n\n\nattachment_fu controllers\n=========================\n\nThere are two considerations to take into account when using attachment_fu in controllers.\n\nThe first is when the files have no publicly accessible path and need to be downloaded through an action.\n\nExample:\n  def readme\n    send_file '/path/to/readme.txt', :type => 'plain/text', :disposition => 'inline'\n  end\n\nSee the possible values for send_file for reference.\n\n\nThe second is when saving the file when submitted from a form.\nExample in view:\n <%= form.file_field :attachable, :uploaded_data %>\n\nExample in controller:\n  def create\n    @attachable_file = AttachmentMetadataModel.new(params[:attachable])\n    if @attachable_file.save\n      flash[:notice] = 'Attachment was successfully created.'\n      redirect_to attachable_url(@attachable_file)     \n    else\n      render :action => :new\n    end\n  end\n\n",

    "Readme": "attachmerb-fu\n=====================\n\nattachmerb_fu is a port of Rick Olson's famous attachment_fu Rails plugin to merb. It tries to be as orm-agnostic as merb while having the same functionalities as the original plugin.\n\nThis plugin is still in a very alpha state and was only tested with datamapper orm, mini_magick image processor and filesystem storage. It may or may not work for your application\n\nNote: attachmerb_fu requires Merb >= 0.5\n\n\nattachmerb_fu functionality\n===========================\n\nattachmerb_fu facilitates file uploads in Merb.

It is designed to be basic so that the hard part of talking to the\nservices is done, yet they provide a simple interface for you to build\napplications on top of them.\n\nThe main design choice for AwsSum is not modelling hundreds of classes\ndependent on what the data is going in or out, but instead to provide a basic\ninterface which takes a hash for the request and returns a hash of the\nresponse.\n\nServices\n--------\n\nThe ones I'm currently working on are:\n\n* Flickr\n* Amazon Web Services (EC2, ELB, S3, SNS, SQS, CloudFront, etc)\n* RackspaceCloud (CloudServers, CloudFiles)\n* PayPal\n* Twitter\n* GoogleFS\n\nData Normalisation\n------------------\n\nSome web services do weird and wonderful things when returning data whereas\nothers are really nice. Some examples are:\n\n* RackspaceCloud can talk in native JSON (which is very nice)\n* Flickr can return JSON but it's basically already been converted from XML\n* AWS returns only XML which we have to convert ourselves\n* PayPal's Name-Value-Pair interface returns interesting L_BLAH# lists\n\nSometimes it's nice to tidy these up a little bit before returning the data to\nthe calling routine so that it looks like each service returns a clean set of\ndata.\n\nError responses are also dealt with specifically. Generally they are left as-is\nbut bits are copied to another part of the hash ($h->{_error}) along with any\nassociated code or message. Again this is useful for programs so that they\ndon't have to figure out where the errors are for each service and can assume\nthey are always in the same place.\n\nLicense\n-------\n\nCopyright (C) 2010, Apps Attic Ltd.\n\nThis module is free software.

    "Readme": "=============\ntemplatemaker\n=============\n\nGiven a list of text files in a similar format, templatemaker creates a\ntemplate that can extract data from files in that same format.\n\nThe underlying longest-common-substring algorithm is implemented in C\nfor performance.\n\nInstallation\n============\n\nBecause part of templatemaker is implemented in C, you'll need to compile the\nC portion of it. Fortunately, Python makes this easy.\n\nTo install systemwide:\n\n    sudo python setup.py install\n\nTo play around with it without having to install systemwide:\n\n    python setup.py build\n    cp build/lib*/_templatemaker.so .\n    rm -rf build\n\nOverview\n========\n\nThe templatemaker.py module provides a class, Template, that is capable of two\nthings:\n\n    * Given an arbitrary number of strings (called \"Sample Strings\"), it\n      determines the \"least-common denominator\" template -- that is, a string\n      representing all the common substrings, with placeholders (\"holes\") for\n      areas in the Sample Strings that differ.\n\n      For example, these three Sample Strings...\n\n        '<b>this and that</b>'\n        '<b>alex and sue</b>'\n        '<b>fine and dandy</b>'\n\n      ...would produce the following template, where \"!\" represents a \"hole.\"\n\n        '<b>! and !</b>'\n\n    * Once you have a template, you can give it data that is formatted\n      according to that template, and it will \"extract\" a tuple of the \"hole\"\n      values for that particular string.\n\n      Following the above example, giving the template the following data:\n\n        '<b>larry and curly</b>'\n\n      ...would produce the following tuple:\n\n        ('larry', 'curly')\n\n      You can interpret this as \"Hole 0's value is 'larry', and hole 1's value\n      is 'curly'.\"\n\nBasic Python API\n================\n\nHere's how to express the above example in Python code:\n\n    # Import the Template class.\n    >>> from templatemaker import Template\n\n    # Create a Template instance.\n    >>> t = Template()\n\n    # Learn a Sample String.\n    >>> t.learn('<b>this and that</b>')\n\n    # Output the template so far, using the \"!\" character to mark holes.\n    # We've only learned a single string, so the template has no holes.\n    >>> t.as_text('!')\n    '<b>this and that</b>'\n\n    # Learn another string. The True return value means the template gained\n    # at least one hole.\n    >>> t.learn('<b>alex and sue</b>')\n    True\n\n    # Sure enough, the template now has some holes.\n    >>> t.as_text('!')\n    '<b>! and !</b>'\n\n    # Learn another string. This time, the return value is False, which means\n    # the template didn't gain any holes.\n    >>> t.learn('<b>fine and dandy</b>')\n    False\n\n    # The template is the same as before.\n    >>> t.as_text('!')\n    '<b>! and !</b>'\n\n    # Now that we have a template, let's extract some data.\n    >>> t.extract('<b>red and green</b>')\n    ('red', 'green')\n    >>> t.extract('<b>django and stephane</b>')\n    ('django', 'stephane')\n\n    # The extract() method is very literal. It doesn't magically trim\n    # whitespace, nor does it have any knowledge of markup languages such as\n    # HTML.\n    >>> t.extract('<b>  spacy  and <u>underlined</u></b>')\n    ('  spacy ', '<u>underlined</u>')\n\n    # The extract() method will raise the NoMatch exception if the data\n    # doesn't match the template. In this example, the data doesn't have the\n    # leading and trailing \"<b>\" tags.\n    >>> t.extract('this and that')\n    Traceback (most recent call last):\n    ...\n    NoMatch\n\n    # Use the extract_dict() method to get a dictionary instead of a tuple.\n    # extract_dict() requires that you specify a tuple of field names.\n    >>> t.extract_dict('<b>red and green</b>', ('value1', 'value2'))\n    {'value1': 'red', 'value2': 'green'}\n\n    # You can specify None as one or more of the field-name values in\n    # extract_dict(). Any field whose value is None will *not* be included\n    # in the resulting dictionary.\n    >>> t.extract_dict('<b>red and green</b>', ('value1', None))\n    {'value1': 'red'}\n    >>> t.extract_dict('<b>red and green</b>', (None, 'value2'))\n    {'value2': 'green'}\n\nThe as_text() method\n====================\n\nThe as_text() method displays the template as a string, with holes represented\nby a string of your choosing.\n\n    >>> t = Template()\n    >>> t.learn('123 and 456')\n    >>> t.learn('456 and 789')\n    True\n\n    Get the template with \"!\" as the hole-representing string.\n    >>> t.as_text('!')\n    '! and !'\n\n    Get the template with \"{{ var }}\" as the hole-representing string.\n    >>> t.as_text('{{ var }}')\n    '{{ var }} and {{ var }}'\n\nNote that as_text() does *not* perform any escaping if your template contains\nthe hole-representing string:\n\n    >>> t = Template()\n    >>> t.learn('Yes!')\n    >>> t.learn('No!')\n    True\n\n    Here, we use \"!\" as the hole-representing string, and the template contains\n    a literal \"!\" character. The literal character is not escaped, so there is\n    no way to tell apart the literal template character from the\n    hole-representing string.\n    >>> t.as_text('!')\n    '!!'\n\n    Here, we use an underscore to demonstrate that the template contains a\n    literal \"!\" character. This wasn't detectable in the previous statement.\n    >>> t.as_text('_')\n    '_!'\n\nWith this in mind, you should choose a string in as_text() that is highly\nunlikely to appear in your template. But, in any case, you shouldn't rely on\nthe output of as_text() for use in programs; it's solely intended to be a\nvisual aid for humans to see their templates. (The template-maker code has its\nown internal way of representing holes, and it's guaranteed to be unambiguous.\nSee \"The marker character\" below.)\n\nTolerance\n=========\n\nThis template-making algorithm can often be \"too literal\" for one's liking.\nFor example, given these three Sample Strings...\n\n    'my favorite color is blue'\n    'my favorite color is violet'\n    'my favorite color is purple'\n\nThe color is the only text that changes, so one would assume the template would\nbe the following:\n\n    'my favorite color is !'\n\nLet's see what actually happens:\n\n    >>> t = Template()\n    >>> t.learn('my favorite color is blue')\n    >>> t.learn('my favorite color is violet')\n    True\n    >>> t.learn('my favorite color is purple')\n    False\n    >>> t.as_text('!')\n    'my favorite color is !l!e!'\n\nAha, the template-maker was a bit too literal -- it noticed that the strings\n\"blue\", \"violet\" and \"purple\" all contain *something*, then the letter \"l\",\nthen *something*, then the letter \"e\", then *something*. Technically, that's\ncorrect, but for most applications, this approach misses the forest for the\ntrees.\n\nThere are two ways to solve this problem:\n\n    * Teach a template many, many Sample Strings. The more diverse your input,\n      the less likely this will happen.\n\n    * Use a feature called *tolerance*.\n\nThe template-maker algorithm lets you specify a tolerance -- the minimum\nallowed length of text between holes. This gives you control over avoiding the\nproblem.\n\nTo specify tolerance, just pass the ``tolerance`` argument to the Template\nconstructor. Here's the above example with a tolerance=1.\n\n    >>> t = Template(tolerance=1)\n    >>> t.learn('my favorite color is blue')\n    >>> t.learn('my favorite color is violet')\n    True\n    >>> t.learn('my favorite color is purple')\n    False\n    >>> t.as_text('!')\n    'my favorite color is !'\n\nAha! Now, that's more like it.\n\nSetting tolerance is useful for small cases like this, but note that there is a\nrisk of throwing the baby out with the bathwater, depending on how high your\ntolerance is set. If the tolerance is set too high, your output template might\nbe \"watered down\" -- less accurate than it possibly could be.\n\nFor example, say we have a list of HTML strings representing significant\nevents:\n\n    <p>My birthday is <span style=\"color: blue;\">Dec. 11, 1954</span>.</p>\n    <p>My wife's birthday is <span style=\"color: red;\">Jan. 3, 1957</span>.</p>\n    <p>Our wedding fell on <span style=\"color: green;\">Sep. 24, 1982</span>.</p>\n\nSay we'd like to extract five pieces of data from each string: the event, the\nHTML color, the month, the day and the year. Here's what we might do in Python:\n\n    >>> t = Template(tolerance=5)\n    >>> t.learn('<p>My birthday is <span style=\"color: blue;\">Dec. 11, 1954</span>.</p>')\n    >>> t.learn('<p>My wife\\'s birthday is <span style=\"color: red;\">Jan. 3, 1957</span>.</p>')\n    True\n    >>> t.learn('<p>Our wedding fell on <span style=\"color: green;\">Sep. 24, 1982</span>.</p>')\n    True\n    >>> t.as_text('!')\n    '! <span style=\"color: !</span>.</p>'\n\nThis resulting template is correct, but it's watered down.\n\nThis template is, indeed, watered down. You can tell by extracting some data:\n\n    >>> t.extract('<p>My sister\\'s birthday is <span style=\"color: pink;\">Jul. 12, 1952</span>.</p>')\n    (\"<p>My sister's birthday is\", 'pink;\">Jul. 12, 1952')\n\nThis data is messy. Namely, the color of the <span> is in the same data field\nas the event date. Assuming we're interested in getting as granular as\npossible in our parsing, it would be better to set a lower tolerance.\n\n    >>> t = Template(tolerance=1)\n    >>> t.learn('<p>My birthday is <span style=\"color: blue;\">Dec. 11, 1954</span>.</p>')\n    >>> t.learn('<p>My wife\\'s birthday is <span style=\"color: red;\">Jan. 3, 1957</span>.</p>')\n    True\n    >>> t.learn('<p>Our wedding fell on <span style=\"color: green;\">Sep. 24, 1982</span>.</p>')\n    False\n    >>> t.as_text('!')\n    '<p>! <span style=\"color: !;\">!. !, 19!</span>.</p>'\n    >>> t.extract('<p>My sister\\'s birthday is <span style=\"color: pink;\">Jul. 12, 1952</span>.</p>')\n    (\"My sister's birthday is\", 'pink', 'Jul', '12', '52')\n\nMuch better.\n\nUsing tolerance is all about tradeoffs. To use this feature most effectively,\nyou'll need to experiment and consider the nature of the data you're parsing.\n\nVersions\n========\n\nA Template instance keeps tracks of how many Sample Strings it has learned.\nYou can access this via the ``version`` attribute.\n\n    >>> t = Template()\n    >>> t.version\n    0\n    >>> t.learn('My name is Paul.')\n    >>> t.version\n    1\n    >>> t.learn('My name is Jonas.')\n    True\n    >>> t.version\n    2\n\nThe marker character\n====================\n\nThe template-maker algorithm, implemented in C, works by comparing two strings\none byte at a time. Each time you call learn(some_string) on a template object,\nthe underlying C algorithm compares some_string to the *current template*.\n\nA template internally represents each hole with a *marker character* -- a\ncharacter that is guaranteed not to appear in either string. This is set to the\ncharacter \"\\x1f\".\n\nIn order to guarantee that the marker character doesn't appear in a string, the\nTemplate's learn() method removes any occurrence of the marker character from\nthe input string before running the comparison algorithm.\n\nThe advantage of this \"dumb\" approach is its simplicity: the C implementation\ndoesn't have to treat markers as a special case. As a result, the C code is\ncleaner and faster. Also, it was easier to write. :)\n\nHowever, there are two disadvantages:\n\n    * First, a template effectively cannot contain the literal marker\n      character.\n\n      In practice, this is *highly* unlikely to be a problem, because the\n      marker character is obscure.\n\n    * Two, in the slight chance that a template contains a multi-byte character\n      (e.g., Unicode) that contains the marker character as one of its bytes,\n      the template-maker algorithm will split that Unicode character at that\n      byte. This happens because the underlying C implementation compares\n      single bytes -- it is *not* Unicode-aware.\n\n      In practice, this is *highly* unlikely to be a problem. In order to get\n      bitten by this, you'd need an aforementioned multi-byte character to\n      appear in your template (not just in a Sample String, but in your\n      template -- i.e., in *each* Sample String).\n\n      If it turns out there are significant multi-byte characters that contain\n      the marker character \"\\x1f\", you can change the MARKER value at the top\n      of templatemaker.c and recompile it. Or, suggest a better character to\n      the authors.\n\nChange log\n==========\n\n2007-09-20    0.1.1    Created HTMLTemplate\n2007-07-06    0.1      Initial release\n\n",

If you have 5 app servers then the code update only happens with the primary \nor first server while all others use the shared cache to copy from. The remote cache is a SCM export \ncreated in one of the following two ways.\n\n  1) If :remote_repository_access is not set or is false, a local export is made, compressed\n     and copied to the target host and uncompressed to the remote shared cache.\n  2) If :remote_repository_access returns true, the target host will perform a direct SCM \n     export to the remote shared cache.\n\nDespite which method is used above, the creation of the remote shared cache will only target the primary \napp server using the primary_app_server() method. Again all other app targets assume that this is a \nshared directory accessbile to all. This yeilds faster deployments since capistrano does not have to \nlocally prepare/compress/copy the source to each host.\n\nThis development strategy inherets from the normal Copy deployment strategy and uses many of the same \nmetods/configurations available to that class when needing to perform local export and copy of the source.\nExamples include, :copy_compression, :copy_remote_dir, :copy_dir. Configurations specific to this strategy \nincludes, :shared_cache_dir (parent of all cached revisions) and :remote_repository_access (which determins \nwhat method is used above to create the shared cache).\n\n\n",

    "Readme": "== Welcome to Rails\n\nRails is a web-application framework that includes everything needed to create \ndatabase-backed web applications according to the Model-View-Control pattern. \n\nThis pattern splits the view (also called the presentation) into \"dumb\" templates\nthat are primarily responsible for inserting pre-built data in between HTML tags.\nThe model contains the \"smart\" domain objects (such as Account, Product, Person,\nPost) that holds all the business logic and knows how to persist themselves to\na database. The controller handles the incoming requests (such as Save New Account,\nUpdate Product, Show Post) by manipulating the model and directing data to the view.\n\nIn Rails, the model is handled by what's called an object-relational mapping\nlayer entitled Active Record. This layer allows you to present the data from\ndatabase rows as objects and embellish these data objects with business logic\nmethods. You can read more about Active Record in\nlink:files/vendor/rails/activerecord/README.html.\n\nThe controller and view are handled by the Action Pack, which handles both\nlayers by its two parts: Action View and Action Controller. These two layers\nare bundled in a single package due to their heavy interdependence. This is\nunlike the relationship between the Active Record and Action Pack that is much\nmore separate. Each of these packages can be used independently outside of\nRails.  You can read more about Action Pack in\nlink:files/vendor/rails/actionpack/README.html.\n\n\n== Getting Started\n\n1. At the command prompt, start a new Rails application using the <tt>rails</tt> command\n   and your application name. Ex: rails myapp\n2. Change directory into myapp and start the web server: <tt>script/server</tt> (run with --help for options)\n3. Go to http://localhost:3000/ and get \"Welcome aboard: You're riding the Rails!\"\n4. Follow the guidelines to start developing your application\n\n\n== Web Servers\n\nBy default, Rails will try to use Mongrel and lighttpd if they are installed, otherwise\nRails will use WEBrick, the webserver that ships with Ruby. When you run script/server,\nRails will check if Mongrel exists, then lighttpd and finally fall back to WEBrick. This ensures\nthat you can always get up and running quickly.\n\nMongrel is a Ruby-based webserver with a C component (which requires compilation) that is\nsuitable for development and deployment of Rails applications. If you have Ruby Gems installed,\ngetting up and running with mongrel is as easy as: <tt>gem install mongrel</tt>.\nMore info at: http://mongrel.rubyforge.org\n\nIf Mongrel is not installed, Rails will look for lighttpd. It's considerably faster than\nMongrel and WEBrick and also suited for production use, but requires additional\ninstallation and currently only works well on OS X/Unix (Windows users are encouraged\nto start with Mongrel). We recommend version 1.4.11 and higher. You can download it from\nhttp://www.lighttpd.net.\n\nAnd finally, if neither Mongrel or lighttpd are installed, Rails will use the built-in Ruby\nweb server, WEBrick. WEBrick is a small Ruby web server suitable for development, but not\nfor production.\n\nBut of course its also possible to run Rails on any platform that supports FCGI.\nApache, LiteSpeed, IIS are just a few. For more information on FCGI,\nplease visit: http://wiki.rubyonrails.com/rails/pages/FastCGI\n\n\n== Apache .htaccess example\n\n# General Apache options\nAddHandler fastcgi-script .fcgi\nAddHandler cgi-script .cgi\nOptions +FollowSymLinks +ExecCGI\n\n# If you don't want Rails to look in certain directories,\n# use the following rewrite rules so that Apache won't rewrite certain requests\n# \n# Example:\n#   RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} ^/notrails.*\n#   RewriteRule .* - [L]\n\n# Redirect all requests not available on the filesystem to Rails\n# By default the cgi dispatcher is used which is very slow\n# \n# For better performance replace the dispatcher with the fastcgi one\n#\n# Example:\n#   RewriteRule ^(.*)$ dispatch.fcgi [QSA,L]\nRewriteEngine On\n\n# If your Rails application is accessed via an Alias directive,\n# then you MUST also set the RewriteBase in this htaccess file.\n#\n# Example:\n#   Alias /myrailsapp /path/to/myrailsapp/public\n#   RewriteBase /myrailsapp\n\nRewriteRule ^$ index.html [QSA]\nRewriteRule ^([^.]+)$ $1.html [QSA]\nRewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f\nRewriteRule ^(.*)$ dispatch.cgi [QSA,L]\n\n# In case Rails experiences terminal errors\n# Instead of displaying this message you can supply a file here which will be rendered instead\n# \n# Example:\n#   ErrorDocument 500 /500.html\n\nErrorDocument 500 \"<h2>Application error</h2>Rails application failed to start properly\"\n\n\n== Debugging Rails\n\nSometimes your application goes wrong.  Fortunately there are a lot of tools that\nwill help you debug it and get it back on the rails.\n\nFirst area to check is the application log files.  Have \"tail -f\" commands running\non the server.log and development.log. Rails will automatically display debugging\nand runtime information to these files. Debugging info will also be shown in the\nbrowser on requests from 127.0.0.1.\n\nYou can also log your own messages directly into the log file from your code using\nthe Ruby logger class from inside your controllers. Example:\n\n  class WeblogController < ActionController::Base\n    def destroy\n      @weblog = Weblog.find(params[:id])\n      @weblog.destroy\n      logger.info(\"#{Time.now} Destroyed Weblog ID ##{@weblog.id}!\")\n    end\n  end\n\nThe result will be a message in your log file along the lines of:\n\n  Mon Oct 08 14:22:29 +1000 2007 Destroyed Weblog ID #1\n\nMore information on how to use the logger is at http://www.ruby-doc.org/core/\n\nAlso, Ruby documentation can be found at http://www.ruby-lang.org/ including:\n\n* The Learning Ruby (Pickaxe) Book: http://www.ruby-doc.org/docs/ProgrammingRuby/\n* Learn to Program: http://pine.fm/LearnToProgram/  (a beginners guide)\n\nThese two online (and free) books will bring you up to speed on the Ruby language\nand also on programming in general.\n\n\n== Debugger\n\nDebugger support is available through the debugger command when you start your Mongrel or\nWebrick server with --debugger. This means that you can break out of execution at any point\nin the code, investigate and change the model, AND then resume execution! \nYou need to install ruby-debug to run the server in debugging mode. With gems, use 'gem install ruby-debug'\nExample:\n\n  class WeblogController < ActionController::Base\n    def index\n      @posts = Post.find(:all)\n      debugger\n    end\n  end\n\nSo the controller will accept the action, run the first line, then present you\nwith a IRB prompt in the server window. Here you can do things like:\n\n  >> @posts.inspect\n  => \"[#<Post:0x14a6be8 @attributes={\\\"title\\\"=>nil, \\\"body\\\"=>nil, \\\"id\\\"=>\\\"1\\\"}>,\n       #<Post:0x14a6620 @attributes={\\\"title\\\"=>\\\"Rails you know!\\\", \\\"body\\\"=>\\\"Only ten..\\\", \\\"id\\\"=>\\\"2\\\"}>]\"\n  >> @posts.first.title = \"hello from a debugger\"\n  => \"hello from a debugger\"\n\n...and even better is that you can examine how your runtime objects actually work:\n\n  >> f = @posts.first\n  => #<Post:0x13630c4 @attributes={\"title\"=>nil, \"body\"=>nil, \"id\"=>\"1\"}>\n  >> f.\n  Display all 152 possibilities? (y or n)\n\nFinally, when you're ready to resume execution, you enter \"cont\"\n\n\n== Console\n\nYou can interact with the domain model by starting the console through <tt>script/console</tt>.\nHere you'll have all parts of the application configured, just like it is when the\napplication is running. You can inspect domain models, change values, and save to the\ndatabase. Starting the script without arguments will launch it in the development environment.\nPassing an argument will specify a different environment, like <tt>script/console production</tt>.\n\nTo reload your controllers and models after launching the console run <tt>reload!</tt>\n\n== dbconsole\n\nYou can go to the command line of your database directly through <tt>script/dbconsole</tt>.\nYou would be connected to the database with the credentials defined in database.yml.\nStarting the script without arguments will connect you to the development database. Passing an\nargument will connect you to a different database, like <tt>script/dbconsole production</tt>.\nCurrently works for mysql, postgresql and sqlite.\n\n== Description of Contents\n\napp\n  Holds all the code that's specific to this particular application.\n\napp/controllers\n  Holds controllers that should be named like weblogs_controller.rb for\n  automated URL mapping. All controllers should descend from ApplicationController\n  which itself descends from ActionController::Base.\n\napp/models\n  Holds models that should be named like post.rb.\n  Most models will descend from ActiveRecord::Base.\n\napp/views\n  Holds the template files for the view that should be named like\n  weblogs/index.html.erb for the WeblogsController#index action. All views use eRuby\n  syntax.\n\napp/views/layouts\n  Holds the template files for layouts to be used with views. This models the common\n  header/footer method of wrapping views. In your views, define a layout using the\n  <tt>layout :default</tt> and create a file named default.html.erb. Inside default.html.erb,\n  call <% yield %> to render the view using this layout.\n\napp/helpers\n  Holds view helpers that should be named like weblogs_helper.rb. These are generated\n  for you automatically when using script/generate for controllers. Helpers can be used to\n  wrap functionality for your views into methods.\n\nconfig\n  Configuration files for the Rails environment, the routing map, the database, and other dependencies.\n\ndb\n  Contains the database schema in schema.rb.  db/migrate contains all\n  the sequence of Migrations for your schema.\n\ndoc\n  This directory is where your application documentation will be stored when generated\n  using <tt>rake doc:app</tt>\n\nlib\n  Application specific libraries. Basically, any kind of custom code that doesn't\n  belong under controllers, models, or helpers. This directory is in the load path.\n\npublic\n  The directory available for the web server. Contains subdirectories for images, stylesheets,\n  and javascripts. Also contains the dispatchers and the default HTML files. This should be\n  set as the DOCUMENT_ROOT of your web server.\n\nscript\n  Helper scripts for automation and generation.\n\ntest\n  Unit and functional tests along with fixtures. When using the script/generate scripts, template\n  test files will be generated for you and placed in this directory.\n\nvendor\n  External libraries that the application depends on. Also includes the plugins subdirectory.\n  If the app has frozen rails, those gems also go here, under vendor/rails/.\n  This directory is in the load path.\n\n",

(If a parent is closed, a child is not editable, etc.) Permission is as simple as true or false.\nRails 3\nRESTful_ACL 3.1 and on are Rails 3 ready. Rails 2 will no longer be supported. Sorries.\nRequirements\nRESTful_ACL requires the notion of a current_user. Most authenticaion plugins provide this (AuthLogic, RESTful_Authentication, etc.)\nHow to Install\nInstall the RESTful_ACL gem:\nsudo gem install restful_acl -s http://gemcutter.org\n\nAdd the gem to your Gemfile file as thus:\ngem \"restful_acl\"\n\nRESTful_ACL requires a named route named \"denied\". Add the following to your routes.rb file:\nmap.denied 'denied', :controller => 'some_controller', :action => 'denied_action'\n\nControllers\nAdd before_filter :has_permission? into any controller that you'd like to restrict access to (or application_controller.rb for your entire app).\nModels\nDefine the following five methods in the model of every resource you'd like to restrict access to. The five methods can contain anything you'd like so long as they return a boolean true or false. This allows you to define your User's roles any way you wish.\nclass Issue < ActiveRecord::Base\n\n  # This method checks permissions for the :index action\n  def self.is_indexable_by(user, parent = nil)\n  end\n\n  # This method checks permissions for the :create and :new action\n  def self.is_creatable_by(user, parent = nil)\n  end\n\n  # This method checks permissions for the :show action\n  def is_readable_by(user, parent = nil)\n  end\n\n  # This method checks permissions for the :update and :edit action\n  def is_updatable_by(user, parent = nil)\n  end\n\n  # This method checks permissions for the :destroy action\n  def is_deletable_by(user, parent = nil)\n  end\n\nend\n\nParent / Child resources\nSometimes actions should only be allowable on a resource if some \"parent\" resource allows them. Contextual permissions FTW.\nLink your \"child\" resource with its \"parent\" resource by using the logical_parent macro and you'll have access to the \"parent\" resource in your child's RESTful_ACL methods.\nclass Child < ActiveRecord::Base\n  logical_parent :parent\n  ...\nend\n\nIf the \"child\" resource is a singleton, just pass :singleton to the logical_parent macro:\nclass Car < ActiveRecord::Base\n  logical_parent :owner, :singleton\n  ...\nend\n\nView Helper\nRESTful_ACL adds a view helper called allowed?. Simply pass this method a block containing the URL you'd like to check permission on and it will do the rest.\nThe link will appear if the current_user is allowed to access the passed-in link's action.\n= allowed?{ link_to \u2018Foo Index\u2019, foos_path }\n= allowed?{ link_to 'Edit Foo', edit_foo_path(@foo) }\n= allowed?{ link_to 'Create Foo', new_foo_path }\n= allowed?{ link_to 'View Foo', foo_path(@foo) }\n= allowed?{ link_to 'Delete Foo', foo_path(@foo), :method => :delete }\n\nHuh? Here's an example\nLet's say that you have two resources: Project and Issue. A Project has many Issues, an Issue belongs to a Project. I'd like to make sure that the current user is a member of the Project before they can create a new Issue in that Project:\nclass Issue < ActiveRecord::Base\n  logical_parent :project\n\n  belongs_to :author\n  belongs_to :project\n\n  def self.is_indexable_by(user, parent = nil)\n    user.projects.include?(parent)\n  end\n\n  def self.is_creatable_by(user, parent = nil)\n    user.projects.include?(parent)\n  end\n\n  def is_updatable_by(user, parent = nil)\n    user == author && parent.is_active?\n  end\n\n  def is_deletable_by(user, parent = nil)\n    user == author\n  end\n\n  def is_readable_by(user, parent = nil)\n    user.projects.include?(parent)\n  end\nend\n\nIf you still have questions, please checkout the test app\nAdmins RULE!\nRESTful_ACL grants global access to all actions to site administrators. To enable this, make sure that your User model defines an is_admin? method and/or an is_admin attribute. If the current_user.is_admin? returns true, access will be granted automatically.\nHow to Test\nI normally do something along these lines in RSpec:\ndescribe \"Issue\" do\n  before do\n    @project = mock_model(:project)\n    @author  = mock_model(:user, :projects => [@project])\n    @issue   = Factory(:issue, :author => @author, :project => @project)\n  end\n\n  it \"should be modifiable by the author when the Project is active\" do\n    @project.stub!(:is_active? => true)\n    @issue.is_updatable_by(@author, @project).should be_true\n  end\n\n  it \"should be deletable by the author\" do\n    @issue.is_deletable_by(@author, @project).should be_true\n  end\n\n  it \"should be readable by those assigned to the Project\" do\n    Issue.is_readable_by(@author, @project).should be_true\n  end\n\n  it \"should be creatable by those assigned to the Project\" do\n    Issue.is_creatable_by(@author, @project).should be_true\n  end\nend\n\nAbout the Author\nMy name is Matt Darby.

Once that's done you might want to modify key methods to customize the logging:\n\n  render_404(exception) - Shows the 404 template.\n\n  render_500(exception) - Shows the 500 template.\n\n  log_exception(exception) - Logs the actual exception in the database.\n\n  rescue_action_in_public(exception) - Does not log these exceptions: ActiveRecord::RecordNotFound, ActionController::UnknownController, ActionController::UnknownAction\n\nAfter that, visit /logged_exceptions in your application to manage the exceptions.\n\nIt's understandable that you may want to require authentication.  Add this to your config/environments/production.rb:\n\n  # config/environments/production.rb\n  config.after_initialize do\n    require 'application' unless Object.const_defined?(:ApplicationController)\n    LoggedExceptionsController.class_eval do\n      # set the same session key as the app\n      session :session_key => '_beast_session_id'\n\n      # include any custom auth modules you need\n      include AuthenticationSystem\n\n      before_filter :login_required\n\n      # optional, sets the application name for the rss feeds\n      self.application_name = \"Beast\"\n\n      protected\n        # only allow admins\n        # this obviously depends on how your auth system works\n        def authorized?\n          current_user.is_a?(Admin)\n        end\n\n        # assume app's login required doesn't use http basic\n        def login_required_with_basic\n          respond_to do |accepts|\n            # alias_method_chain will alias the app's login_required to login_required_without_basic\n            accepts.html { login_required_without_basic }\n\n            # access_denied_with_basic_auth is defined in LoggedExceptionsController\n            # get_auth_data returns back the user/password pair\n            accepts.rss do\n              access_denied_with_basic_auth unless self.current_user = User.authenticate(*get_auth_data)\n            end\n          end\n        end\n\n        alias_method_chain :login_required, :basic\n    end\n  end\n\nThe exact code of course depends on the specific needs of your application.\n\nCREDITS\n\nJamis Buck  - original exception_notification plugin\nRick Olson  - model/controller code\nJosh Goebel - design\n",

    "Readme": "\nROpenLaszlo: Interface to the OpenLaszlo compiler\nROpenLaszo is a Ruby interface to the OpenLaszlo compiler.  It allows you to\ncompile OpenLaszlo programs from within Ruby, in order to integrate\nOpenLaszlo development into Rake files or Rails applications.\nIf you are using OpenLaszlo with Ruby on Rails, you want the OpenLaszlo Rails plugin too. \nThat page contains instructions for installing both the gem and the plugin;\nyou can read those instructions instead of these.\nOverview\nOpenLaszlo programs are written in XML with embedded JavaScript, and\ncompiled into either Flash (swf) binary files, or DHTML.  The APIs in this\nlibrary make it easy for Ruby code to invoke the OpenLaszlo compiler.  For\nexample, if hello.lzx contains the following text:\n<canvas>\n  <window>\n    <button>Hello, World!</button>\n  </window>\n</canvas>\nthen the following Ruby code can be used to create a file\n'hello.swf' which can be executed in a browser or placed on a web\nsite:\nrequire 'rubygems'\nrequire 'openlaszlo'\nOpenLaszlo::compile 'hello.lzx' # creates hello.swf\nYou can turn this snippet into a Rake task that will compile any OpenLaszlo\nsource file:\nrule '.swf' => '.lzx' do |t|\n  puts \"Compiling #{t.source} => #{t.name}\" if verbose\n  OpenLaszlo::compile t.source, :output => t.name\nend\nThe following includes such a task:\nrequire 'openlaszlo'\nload 'tasks/openlaszlo.rake'\n# defines a pattern *.lzx -> *.swf\nRequirements\n\nOpenLaszlo 3.1 or later\n\nRuby -v 1.8.2 or later (untested in earlier versions)\n\nRubyGems\n\nInstallation\n0\n\nDownload and install the OpenLaszlo SDK\n\n1: Install this gem\n$ sudo gem install ropenlaszlo\n2\n\nSet your OPENLASZLO_HOME environment variable to the directory\nthat contains the OpenLaszlo SDK.  If\nthe following prints something, you've got it right:\n\n$ grep Laszlo \"$OPENLASZLO_HOME/README.txt\"\n3\n\n(Optional)  Set your OPENLASZLO_URL environment variable to the\nweb location of the OpenLaszlo server; for example,\nhttp://localhost:8080/lps-3.1.  If you omit this step, the module\nwill use the command line compiler, which is slower but is not limited to\ncompiling files inside of OPENLASZLO_HOME.\n\nNote: The command-line compiler is broken in the Windows version of\nOpenLaszlo 3.1.1.  If you are running Windows, step (3) is required.  (OpenLaszlo bug\n1428)\nTips\nThe Ruby front end to the compiler uses two compilation methods.  If\nOPENLASZLO_URL is set, and the source file is in a subdirectory of the\nOpenLaszlo servlet directory, then the compiler will request the URL that\ncorresponds to the source location.  Otherwise, the OpenLaszlo command-line\ncompiler is used.\nIf the compiler is going to be invoked more than once (because several\nfiles are being compiled, or because the compiler is being used in an\nedit/compile/run cycle), the compile server is faster.\nYou can place a symbolic link to a source directory in the OpenLaszlo\nservlet directory thus:\nrequire 'openlaszlo/utils'\nOpenLaszlo::symlink_to '.'\nAdditional Resources\n\nThe OpenLaszlo Rails\nplugin provides generators, view tasks, and rake tasks for using\nOpenLaszlo with Ruby on Rails.\n\nThe OpenLaszlo web site is a rich\nsource of information about the OpenLaszlo platform.  It includes links to\nthe wiki, mailing lists, and forums.\n\nThis\nOpenLaszlo Blog entry has additional information and some examples of\nusing ROpenLaszlo in a Rakefile.\n\nROpenLaszlo RubyForge\nproject page\n\nROpenLaszlo git\nrepository\n\nAuthor\nOliver Steele <steele@osteele.com>\nLicense\nROpenLaszlo is copyright (C) 2006 - 2009 by Oliver Steele.

    "Name": "openlaszlo_plugin",
    "Readme": "\nOpenLaszlo Rails Plugin\nThe OpenLaszlo Rails plugin makes it easy to use OpenLaszlo client-side applications with\nRails.  It includes a generator and helper for creating OpenLaszlo\napplications and displaying them within Rails views.\nFor example, the following shell command will create an OpenLaszlo\napplication named applet, and a view named\ncontroller/index.  Requesting the view will recompile the applet.\n$ ./script/generate applet contact applet\nView Helper\nThe plugin introduces two view helpers.  swfobject_tag generates\ncode that embeds a flash object in the page (using the swfobject JavaScript\nlibrary). applet_tag additionally recompiles the applet if it is\nout of date, and swaps in a version of the applet compiled with the debug\nflag set if the debug query parameter is present in the request\nthat resulted in the call \u2013 both of these additional features are available\nonly in development mode.\nGenerators\nThe plugin defines the following generators, that can be used to quickly\ncreate an OpenLaszlo stub application and a view that displays it.\nThis generates an OpenLaszlo source file in app/applets/my-app:\n$ ./script/generate applet my-app\nThis also creates a model and view at /my-controller/index that\ndisplays the applet.  When the app's source changes, requesting the\nview recompiles the app.\n$ ./script/generate applet my-app my-controller index\nRails Tasks\nThe plugin defines the following tasks:\n# Recompile any applets in the app/applets directory\nrake openlaszlo:build:applets\n\n# Clean the applets directory\nrake openlaszlo:clobber:applets\n\n# Copies the swfobject javascripts to public/javascripts\nrake openlaszlo:install:javascripts\nRequirements\n\nRails 2.0 or later.  (Might work with earlier versions, but is untested\nwith them.)\n\nOpenLaszlo 3.1 or later\n\nThe OpenLaszlo ruby gem\n\nInstallation (using templates; for Rails 2.3 or later)\nIn Rails 2.3 or later, you can use the Rails template mechanism to install\nthe OpenLaszlo plugin and the gem that it depends on.\nThe template requires that you give it sudo access, in order to\nrun sudo rake gems:install.  If you don't want to or can't\ndo this, you can use the instructions for previous versions of Rails below.\nTo create a new Rails app:\nrails webapp -m http://gist.github.com/83809.txt\nTo upgrade an existing app:\nrake rails:template LOCATION=http://gist.github.com/83809.txt\nTo create a new Rails app, or upgrade an existing one, and create a\nstarter applet that's served from /home/applet, do one of:\ngenerate=myapp rails webapp -m http://gist.github.com/83809.txt\ngenerate=myapp rake rails:template LOCATION=http://gist.github.com/83809.txt\nInstallation (Rails 2.1 or later)\n0: Install OpenLaszlo, Ruby, and Ruby on Rails.\n1: In config/environment, place the following code inside the\nRails::Initializer.run block:\nconfig.gem 'ropenlaszlo', :lib => 'openlaszlo', :version => '>= 0.6.3'\n2: Install the ropenlaszlo gem:\n$ sudo rake gems:install\n3: Install this plugin:\n$ ./script/plugin install git://github.com/osteele/openlaszlo_plugin.git\n4: Set the OPENLASZLO_HOME environment variable to the directory\nthat contains the OpenLaszlo SDK.  The first line below is an example of\nthis in bash (although you will probably want to put this in your\n.bashrc or .profile too). If you're not using\nWindows, the second line of shell script will tell you whether you've\nset it right.\n$ export OPENLASZLO_HOME=\"/Applications/OpenLaszlo Server 4.2.0.2\"\n$ grep -qs Laszlo \"$OPENLASZLO_HOME/README.txt\" && echo yes || echo no\nUsage\nIn your RAILS application directory:\n1: Create an applet, and a view that displays it:\n$ ./script/generate applet my-applet controller index\n2: Compile the applet (this step is optional):\n$ rake openlaszlo:build:applets\nNow launch the server (script/server), and you can view your\napplet at http:127.0.0.1:3000/controller/index.\nUsing the Compile Server\nThe steps described above use the OpenLaszlo command-line compiler to\ncompile applications.  A faster technique, although one that requires more\nconfiguration, is to leave the OpenLaszlo server running as a compile\nserver.\nThe instructions for setting up an OpenLaszlo compile server are here.\nResources\n\nOpenLaszlo Plugin\nRubyforge project page\n\nOpenLaszlo Plugin\nGithub repository\n\nOpenLaszlo\nPlugin Wiki\n\nOpenLaszlo Site\n\nOpenLaszlo Gem project\npage\n\nswfobject\n\nAuthors\n\nOliver Steele\n\nMax Carlson\n\n",

    "Readme": "GoogleAuthSub\n=======\n\nNOTE: This is still in very alpha stages of development. \nIt passes all the mocked specs but has no live testing specs yet. \n\nOverview:\n\nThe GoogleAuthSub class handles interaction with Google via the \nAccount Authentication API (AuthSub). This is for web applications to get data from \nGoogle with the user signing in.\n\nFor details on the Account Authentication API refer to:\nhttp://code.google.com/apis/accounts/docs/AuthForWebApps.html\n\nThe Google Group can provide some help also: \nhttp://groups.google.com/group/Google-Accounts-API\n\nThe OAuth protocol has taken over much of the role of Authsub. \nOauth does not provide access to non registered apps as Authsub does.\n\nRequirements:\n    For testing you will need the rspec and fake_web gems\n\nTo use:\n\nNon-signed access, single request.\n    1. Create your GoogleAuthSub object.\n            auth = GoogleAuthSub.new(:next_url => \"www.example.com/next\", \n                    :scope_url => \"http://www.google.com/calendar/feeds\")\n\n    2. Redirect the user to the Google sign in page. request_url gives us the correct url to go to.\n            In rails: \n                redirect_to auth.request_url\n\n    3. Once the user has successfully logged in they will then be redirected back to the url specified\n        as the :next_url in step 1. In the handler for this the token needs to be extracted.\n        To do this call: \n            auth.receive_token(url) \n        or in rails just do: \n            auth.token=params[:token]\n\n    4. Now everything should be set to make a single request with:\n        auth.get(url), auth.post(url), auth.put(url) or auth.delete(url)\n       The url will automagically have the :scope_url prepended to it if not included. \n       These calls return a Net::HTTPResponse object\n\n     Once a request has been made the token will no longer be valid and you will have to start from step 2 in \n     order to make another request.\n\nNon-signed access with session token.\n    1. Create your GoogleAuthSub object with :session => true.\n         auth = GoogleAuthSub.new(:next_url => \"www.example.com/next\", \n            :scope_url => \"http://www.google.com/calendar/feeds\", \n            :session => true)\n\n    2,3 as per previous example\n\n    4. Exchange the single use token for a session token.\n        auth.request_session_token\n        NOTE: this has changed from the previous version, which was confusingly named session_token.\n\n    5. Make requests with auth.get and auth.put.\n\nSecure access with session token.\n    0. Call GoogleAuthSub.set_private_key(key)\n        key can be a certificate file, string or OpenSSL::Pkey::RSA object.\n        This should be the key that the site has registered with Goggle.\n        For details on the registration process see: \n        http://code.google.com/apis/accounts/docs/RegistrationForWebAppsAuto.html\n\n    1. Create your GoogleAuthSub object with :session => true.\n        auth = GoogleAuthSub.new(:next_url => \"www.example.com/next\", \n            :scope_url => \"http://www.google.com/calendar/feeds\", \n            :session => true, :secure=>true)\n\n    2,3,4,5 as per previous examples\n\n    The private key is stored as a class variable so there is one instance per app.\n\nTokens can be revoked with:\n    auth.revoke_token\n\nToken information can be received from Google with:\n    auth.token_info\n    This returns a hash with the keys: :target, :scope and :secure\n\n\nTODO:\n    Live tests.

See below for the wide variety of formats Chronic will parse.\n\n== INSTALLATION:\n\nChronic can be installed via RubyGems:\n\n  $ sudo gem install chronic\n\n== CODE:\n\nBrowse the code and get an RSS feed of the commit log at:\n\n  http://github.com/mojombo/chronic.git\n\nYou can grab the code (and help with development) via git:\n\n  $ git clone git://github.com/mojombo/chronic.git\n\n== USAGE:\n\nYou can parse strings containing a natural language date using the Chronic.parse method.\n\n  require 'rubygems'\n  require 'chronic'\n\n  Time.now   #=> Sun Aug 27 23:18:25 PDT 2006\n\n  #---\n\n  Chronic.parse('tomorrow')       \n    #=> Mon Aug 28 12:00:00 PDT 2006\n\n  Chronic.parse('monday', :context => :past)\n    #=> Mon Aug 21 12:00:00 PDT 2006\n\n  Chronic.parse('this tuesday 5:00')\n    #=> Tue Aug 29 17:00:00 PDT 2006\n\n  Chronic.parse('this tuesday 5:00', :ambiguous_time_range => :none)\n    #=> Tue Aug 29 05:00:00 PDT 2006\n\n  Chronic.parse('may 27th', :now => Time.local(2000, 1, 1))\n    #=> Sat May 27 12:00:00 PDT 2000\n\n  Chronic.parse('may 27th', :guess => false)\n    #=> Sun May 27 00:00:00 PDT 2007..Mon May 28 00:00:00 PDT 2007\n\nSee Chronic.parse for detailed usage instructions.\n\n== EXAMPLES:\n\nChronic can parse a huge variety of date and time formats. Following is a small sample of strings that will be properly parsed. Parsing is case insensitive and will handle common abbreviations and misspellings.\n\nSimple\n\n  thursday\n  november\n  summer\n  friday 13:00\n  mon 2:35\n  4pm\n  6 in the morning\n  friday 1pm\n  sat 7 in the evening\n  yesterday\n  today\n  tomorrow\n  this tuesday\n  next month\n  last winter\n  this morning\n  last night\n  this second\n  yesterday at 4:00\n  last friday at 20:00\n  last week tuesday\n  tomorrow at 6:45pm\n  afternoon yesterday\n  thursday last week\n\nComplex\n\n  3 years ago\n  5 months before now\n  7 hours ago\n  7 days from now\n  1 week hence\n  in 3 hours\n  1 year ago tomorrow\n  3 months ago saturday at 5:00 pm\n  7 hours before tomorrow at noon\n  3rd wednesday in november\n  3rd month next year\n  3rd thursday this september\n  4th day last week\n\nSpecific Dates\n\n  January 5\n  dec 25\n  may 27th\n  October 2006\n  oct 06\n  jan 3 2010\n  february 14, 2004\n  3 jan 2000\n  17 april 85\n  5/27/1979\n  27/5/1979\n  05/06\n  1979-05-27\n  Friday\n  5\n  4:00\n  17:00\n  0800\n\nSpecific Times (many of the above with an added time)\n\n  January 5 at 7pm\n  1979-05-27 05:00:00\n  etc\n\n== LIMITATIONS:\n\nChronic uses Ruby's built in Time class for all time storage and computation. Because of this, only times that the Time class can handle will be properly parsed. Parsing for times outside of this range will simply return nil. Support for a wider range of times is planned for a future release.\n\nTime zones other than the local one are not currently supported. Support for other time zones is planned for a future release.\n\n== LICENSE:\n\n(The MIT License)\n\nCopyright (c) 2008 Tom Preston-Werner\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining\na copy of this software and associated documentation files (the\n\"Software\"), to deal in the Software without restriction, including\nwithout limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish,\ndistribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to\npermit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to\nthe following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be\nincluded in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,\nEXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF\nMERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.\nIN NO EVENT SHALL THE AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY\nCLAIM, DAMAGES OR OTHER LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT,\nTORT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM, OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE\nSOFTWARE OR THE USE OR OTHER DEALINGS IN THE SOFTWARE.\n\n",

    "Readme": "Custom Resource Name 1.2\n========================\n\nThe Custom Resource Name Plugin lets you add aliases for your routes. This is very useful if you are developing a software to a country that does not speak English and wants all URLs in the native language.\n\nTo install the plugin is very simple. The plugin is on the GitHub. If you have Git installed, take the plugin using the command:\n\ngit clone git://github.com/carlosbrando/custom_resource_name.git custom_resource_name\n\nIf you don\u2019t use Git (should\u2026) you can download the plugin and then copy the files into the folder vendor/plugins of your project.\nTo download: http://github.com/carlosbrando/custom_resource_name/tarball/master\n\nTo use it is simpler yet. Open the file routes.rb of your project and include the following lines BEFORE the routes that should be translated:\n\n# translate resources\nmap.aliases :resources, :posts => \u2018artigos\u2018, :comments => \u2018comentarios\u2018\n\n# translate singleton resources\nmap.aliases :resource, :comment => 'comentario'\n\n# translate actions\nmap.aliases :actions, :new => \u2018novo\u2018, :edit => \u2018editar\u2018, :logout => \u2018sair\u2018\n\n# translate namespaces\nmap.aliases :namespaces, :admin => \u2018administrativo\u2018\n\nIf you have any english route that should stay untouched, put it before the aliases definition.\n\nReady!\n\nYou can add aliases for all its resources and actions.\n\n\nNew feature\n===========\n\nAdded one more feature to plugin. Imagine the following case:\n\nActionController::Routing::Routes.draw do |map|\n  map.aliases :resources, :houses => 'casas'\n  map.aliases :actions, :new => 'novo'\n\n  map.resources :houses\nend\n\nSee that all actions :new will be replaced by 'novo', but this does not fit properly in resource :casas, which would correct be 'nova' and not 'novo' (is just one example).\n\nIn this case we can use the option :actions_as in the resources, like this:\n\nmap.resources :houses, :actions_as => {:new => 'nova'}\n\nProblem solved. In all other cases the action :new will be called 'novo', but only in the resource :casas it will be 'nova'.\n\nIn addition we also have the option :as those who do the same thing with the name of the resource.\n\n\n\n\n\nMore info: http://www.nomedojogo.com/custom-resource-name-plugin/\n\nIf this plugin is interesting to you, be sure to recommend me on Working with Rails.\n\nThis plugin has been created by Carlos Brando, a developer of Surgeworks LLC.\n\nCopyright (c) 2008 Carlos Brando, released under the MIT license\n",

WordPress is a very special project to me. Every developer and contributor adds something unique to the mix, and together we create something beautiful that I'm proud to be a part of. Thousands of hours have gone into WordPress, and we're dedicated to making it better every day. Thank you for making it part of your world.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\">&#8212; Matt Mullenweg</p>\n\n<h1>Installation: Famous 5-minute install</h1>\n<ol>\n    <li>Unzip the package in an empty directory.</li>\n    <li>Open up <code>wp-config-sample.php</code> with a text editor like WordPad or similar and fill in your database connection details.</li>\n    <li>Save the file as <code>wp-config.php</code></li>\n    <li>Upload everything.</li>\n    <li>Open <span class=\"file\"><a href=\"wp-admin/install.php\">/wp-admin/install.php</a></span> in your browser. This should setup the tables needed for your blog. If there is an error, double check your <span class=\"file\">wp-config.php</span> file, and try again. If it fails again, please go to the <a href=\"http://wordpress.org/support/\">support forums</a> with as much data as you can gather.</li>\n    <li><strong>Note the password given to you.</strong></li>\n    <li> The install script should then send you to the <a href=\"wp-login.php\">login page</a>. Sign in with the username <code>admin</code> and the password generated during the installation.

That's it!</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>Template Changes</h2>\n<p>If you have customized your templates you will probably have to make some changes to them. If you're converting your 1.2 or earlier templates, <a href=\"http://codex.wordpress.org/Upgrade_1.2_to_1.5\">we've created a special guide for you</a>. </p>\n\n<h1>Online Resources</h1>\n<p>If you have any questions that aren't addressed in this document, please take advantage of WordPress' numerous online resources:</p>\n<dl>\n    <dt><a href=\"http://codex.wordpress.org/\">The WordPress Codex </a></dt>\n        <dd>The Codex is the encyclopedia of all things WordPress.

The work has been continued by the <a href=\"http://wordpress.org/about/\">WordPress developers</a>. If you would like to support WordPress, please consider <a href=\"http://wordpress.org/donate/\">donating</a>.</p>\n\n<h1>Upgrading from another system</h1>\n<p>WordPress can <a href=\"http://codex.wordpress.org/Importing_Content\">import from a number of systems</a>. First you need to get WordPress installed and working as described above.</p>\n\n<h1>XML-RPC and Atom Interface</h1>\n<p>You can now post to your WordPress blog with tools like <a href=\"http://windowslivewriter.spaces.live.com/\">Windows Live Writer</a>, <a href=\"http://ecto.kung-foo.tv/\">Ecto</a>, <a href=\"http://bloggar.com/\">Bloggar</a>, <a href=\"http://radio.userland.com\">Radio Userland</a> (which means you can use Radio's email-to-blog feature), <a href=\"http://www.newzcrawler.com/\">NewzCrawler</a>, and other tools that support the Blogging APIs! :) You can read more about <a href=\"http://codex.wordpress.org/XML-RPC_Support\">XML-RPC support on the Codex</a>.</p>\n\n<h1>Post via Email</h1>\n<p>You can post from an email client! To set this up go to your &quot;Writing&quot; options screen and fill in the connection details for your secret POP3 account. Then you need to set up <code>wp-mail.php</code> to execute periodically to check the mailbox for new posts. You can do it with Cron-jobs, or if your host doesn't support it you can look into the various website-monitoring services, and make them check your <code>wp-mail.php</code> URL.</p>\n<p>Posting is easy: Any email sent to the address you specify will be posted, with the subject as the title. It is best to keep the address discrete. The script will <em>delete</em> emails that are successfully posted.</p>\n\n<h1>User Roles</h1>\n<p>We've eliminated user levels in order to make way for the much more flexible roles system introduced in 2.0. You can <a href=\"http://codex.wordpress.org/Roles_and_Capabilities\">read more about Roles and Capabilities on the Codex</a>.</p>\n\n<h1> Final notes</h1>\n<ul>\n    <li>If you have any suggestions, ideas, comments, or if you (gasp!) found a bug, join us in the <a href=\"http://wordpress.org/support/\">Support Forums</a>.</li>\n    <li>WordPress now has a robust plugin API that makes extending the code easy. If you are a developer interested in utilizing this see the <a href=\"http://codex.wordpress.org/Plugin_API\">plugin documentation in the Codex</a>. In most all cases you shouldn't modify any of the core code.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h1>Share the Love</h1>\n<p>WordPress has no multi-million dollar marketing campaign or celebrity sponsors, but we do have something even better&#8212;you. If you enjoy WordPress please consider telling a friend, setting it up for someone less knowledgable than yourself, or writing the author of a media article that overlooks us.</p>\n\n<h1>Copyright</h1>\n<p>WordPress is released under the <abbr title=\"GNU Public License\">GPL</abbr> (see <a href=\"license.txt\">license.txt</a>).</p>\n\n</body>\n</html>\n\n",

As long as the changes are\nmergeable, you should have no problems.\n\nThis tool has a similar purpose than svnmerge.py which you can find in the\ncontrib/client-side folder of the main Subversion repository at\nhttp://svn.collab.net/repos/svn/trunk/contrib/client-side/svnmerge.py.\nThe main difference is that Piston is designed to work with remote\nrepositories.  Another tool you might want to look at, SVK, which you can find\nat http://svk.elixus.org/.\n\nFrom Wikipedia's Piston page (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piston):\n  In general, a piston is a sliding plug that fits closely inside the bore\n  of a cylinder.\n\n  Its purpose is either to change the volume enclosed by the cylinder, or\n  to exert a force on a fluid inside the cylinder.\n\nFor this utility, I retain the second meaning, \"to exert a force on a fluid\ninside the cylinder.\"  Piston forces the content of a remote repository\nlocation back into our own.\n\n\n= Notes on 2.0\n\nIn the 1.0 era, Piston was exclusively geared towards Subversion repositories.\nIn early 2008, Git gained a lot of popularity among Ruby and Rails coders.\nPiston was rewritten during that period to allow many repositories and working\ncopies to be used together.\n\nThe documentation still refers to Subversion throughout, but 2.0 allows any\nrepository to be used with any working copy.\n\n\n= Installation\n\nNothing could be simpler:\n\n $ gem install piston\n\n\n= Usage\n\nFirst, you need to import the remote repository location:\n\n $ piston import http://dev.rubyonrails.org/svn/rails/trunk vendor/rails\n Exported r4720 from 'http://dev.rubyonrails.org/svn/rails/trunk' to 'vendor/rails'\n\n $ svn commit -m \"Importing local copy of Rails\"\n\nWhen you want to get the latest changes from the remote repository location:\n\n $ piston update vendor/rails\n Updated 'vendor/rails' to r4720.\n\n $ svn commit -m \"Updates vendor/rails to the latest revision\"\n\nYou can prevent a local Piston-managed folder from updating by using the\n+lock+ subcommand:\n\n $ piston lock vendor/rails\n 'vendor/rails' locked at r4720.\n\nWhen you want to update again, you unlock:\n\n $ piston unlock vendor/rails\n 'vendor/rails' unlocked.\n\nIf the branch you are following moves, you should use the switch subcommand:\n\n $ piston import http://dev.rubyonrails.org/svn/rails/branches/1-2-pre-release vendor/rails\n $ svn commit vendor/rails\n\n # Vendor branch is renamed, let's follow it\n $ piston switch http://dev.rubyonrails.org/svn/rails/branches/1-2-stable vendor/rails\n\n\n= Contributions\n\n== Bash Shell Completion Script\n\nMichael Schuerig contributed a Bash shell completion script.  You should copy\n+contrib/piston+ from your gem repository to the appropriate folder.  Michael\nsaid:\n\n  I've put together a bash completion function for piston. On Debian, I\n  just put it in /etc/bash_completion.d, alternatively, the contents can\n  be copied to ~/.bash_completion. I don't know how things are organized\n  on other Unix/Linux systems.\n\n\n= Caveats\n\n== Speed\n\nThis tool is SLOW.  The update process particularly so.  I use a brute force\napproach.  Subversion cannot merge from remote repositories, so instead I\ncheckout the folder at the initial revision, and then run svn update and\nparse the results of that to determine what changes have occured.\n\nIf a local copy of a file was changed, it's changes will be merged back in.\nIf that introduces a conflict, Piston will not detect it.  The commit will be\nrejected by Subversion anyway.\n\n== Copies / Renames\n\nPiston *does not* track copies.  Since Subversion does renames in two\nphases (copy + delete), that is what Piston does.\n\n== Local Operations Only\n\nPiston only works if you have a working copy.  It also never commits your\nworking copy directly.  You are responsible for reviewing the changes and\napplying any pending fixes.\n\n== Remote Repository UUID\n\nPiston caches the remote repository UUID, allowing it to know if the remote\nrepos is still the same.  Piston refuses to work against a different\nrepository than the one we checked out from originally.\n\n\n= Subversion Properties Used\n\n* <tt>piston:uuid</tt>: The remote repository's UUID, which we always confirm\n  before doing any operations.\n* <tt>piston:root</tt>: The repository root URL from which this Piston folder\n  was exported from.\n* <tt>piston:remote-revision</tt>: The <tt>Last Changed Rev</tt> of the remote\n  repository.\n* <tt>piston:local-revision</tt>: The <tt>Last Changed Rev</tt> of the Piston\n  managed folder, to enable us to know if we need to do any merging.\n* <tt>piston:locked</tt>: The revision at which this folder is locked.  If\n  this property is set and non-blank, Piston will skip the folder with\n  an appropriate message.\n\n",

I really don't know.\nI pretty much made it for fun.\nI haven't used other blogging frameworks,\nbut to the best of my knowledge this doesn't have any features they don't.\nI guess you could call it minimalistic,\nbut I'm not really going out of my way to keep it simple.\nI pretty much just add features as I want them.\n\nAt the moment I'm writing this, it does comes with a few reasonably useful features.\nFor those curious for a brief rundown, I'll list them here,\nalthough I don't by any means guarantee that this list will be kept up-to-date.\n\n* You can post posts, or articles, or whatever you want to call them.\n  Shoving stuff up on the front page in an orderly manner.\n  This is a pretty important one for a blog.\n\n* Other people (and you) can comment on your shoved stuff.\n  Start up a conversation of sorts.\n  Not as important, I guess, but still lots of fun.\n\n* You and your commenty buddies can preview your text.\n  Definitely useful if you use the built-in textile formatting for your text.\n  It's nice that it's human-readable and stuff,\n  but you can never really tell how the parser'll do on those edge cases.\n\n* Folks can get updated when you post something.\n  Well, it's Atom-based, so really they can update themselves.\n  But it all looks the same to the user.\n\n* There's this sleek-looking live search.\n  All AJAXy and stuff. Or non-AJAXy if you don't have Javascript.\n  Anyway, you can look through your posts for stuff.\n\n* You can use Akismet to beat off the spam.\n  This is a new one. I don't really know how well it works yet,\n  but Akismet's supposed to be good.\n  We'll see.\n\n== Setting Up\n\nYeah, it's a bit of a pain to set up.\nBut hey, it's O(1).\nYou'll live.\n\nSo, first of all, get all the gems you need.\nIf I'm remembering everything,\nthis means redcloth, rcov, and coderay at the moment.\nEverything else comes in plugins.\n\nNext up, set up config/database.yml.\nThis should be pretty straightforward.\nMake the databases, set the right socket location, etc.\n\nThen run +rake db:migrate+.\nGet all those tables set up.\n\nYou might want to run the specs.\nI encourage it.\nJust do +rake rspec+.\nEverything should pass, or maybe be marked as \"pending.\"\nIf something fails, let me know.\n\nFinally, you need to set up the admin user.\nThere's no way to do this with a GUI,\nso fire up script/console.\nEnter the following,\nwith the appropriate replacements:\n\n  u = User.new\n  u.name = <username>\n  u.password = <password>\n  u.password_confirm = <password>\n  u.admin = true\n\nAfter this, the site should be up and running.\nOn my layout, which I suppose will be the default,\nyou can sign in by clicking that character in the upper right-hand corner.\n\nOnce you sign in, you'll notice a few more links on the sidebar.\nThese allow you to do fun administrative stuff,\nlike create new posts and muck with users and log out.\n\nAt this point, you might want to click the users icon\nand give yourself a link and an email.\n\nOnce that's all done, start posting.\nIf you're feeling particularly generous, link back to me.\nIf not, well, at least enjoy the engine.\n\n== Configuration\n\nMost of the configuration is done by getting your hands dirty.\nMess with the code, change up the layout, that sort of thing.\n\nHowever, for common stuff, there's config/nex3.yml.\nThis contains some variables you can set.\nIt should be pretty self-explanitory.\n\n",

    "Readme": "== Welcome to Rails\n\nRails is a web-application and persistence framework that includes everything\nneeded to create database-backed web-applications according to the\nModel-View-Control pattern of separation. This pattern splits the view (also\ncalled the presentation) into \"dumb\" templates that are primarily responsible\nfor inserting pre-built data in between HTML tags. The model contains the\n\"smart\" domain objects (such as Account, Product, Person, Post) that holds all\nthe business logic and knows how to persist themselves to a database. The\ncontroller handles the incoming requests (such as Save New Account, Update\nProduct, Show Post) by manipulating the model and directing data to the view.\n\nIn Rails, the model is handled by what's called an object-relational mapping\nlayer entitled Active Record. This layer allows you to present the data from\ndatabase rows as objects and embellish these data objects with business logic\nmethods. You can read more about Active Record in\nlink:files/vendor/rails/activerecord/README.html.\n\nThe controller and view are handled by the Action Pack, which handles both\nlayers by its two parts: Action View and Action Controller. These two layers\nare bundled in a single package due to their heavy interdependence. This is\nunlike the relationship between the Active Record and Action Pack that is much\nmore separate. Each of these packages can be used independently outside of\nRails.  You can read more about Action Pack in\nlink:files/vendor/rails/actionpack/README.html.\n\n\n== Getting Started\n\n1. At the command prompt, start a new Rails application using the <tt>rails</tt> command\n   and your application name. Ex: rails myapp\n   (If you've downloaded Rails in a complete tgz or zip, this step is already done)\n2. Change directory into myapp and start the web server: <tt>script/server</tt> (run with --help for options)\n3. Go to http://localhost:3000/ and get \"Welcome aboard: You\u2019re riding the Rails!\"\n4. Follow the guidelines to start developing your application\n\n\n== Web Servers\n\nBy default, Rails will try to use Mongrel and lighttpd if they are installed, otherwise\nRails will use WEBrick, the webserver that ships with Ruby. When you run script/server,\nRails will check if Mongrel exists, then lighttpd and finally fall back to WEBrick. This ensures\nthat you can always get up and running quickly.\n\nMongrel is a Ruby-based webserver with a C component (which requires compilation) that is\nsuitable for development and deployment of Rails applications. If you have Ruby Gems installed,\ngetting up and running with mongrel is as easy as: <tt>gem install mongrel</tt>.\nMore info at: http://mongrel.rubyforge.org\n\nIf Mongrel is not installed, Rails will look for lighttpd. It's considerably faster than\nMongrel and WEBrick and also suited for production use, but requires additional\ninstallation and currently only works well on OS X/Unix (Windows users are encouraged\nto start with Mongrel). We recommend version 1.4.11 and higher. You can download it from\nhttp://www.lighttpd.net.\n\nAnd finally, if neither Mongrel or lighttpd are installed, Rails will use the built-in Ruby\nweb server, WEBrick. WEBrick is a small Ruby web server suitable for development, but not\nfor production.\n\nBut of course its also possible to run Rails on any platform that supports FCGI.\nApache, LiteSpeed, IIS are just a few. For more information on FCGI,\nplease visit: http://wiki.rubyonrails.com/rails/pages/FastCGI\n\n\n== Debugging Rails\n\nSometimes your application goes wrong.  Fortunately there are a lot of tools that\nwill help you debug it and get it back on the rails.\n\nFirst area to check is the application log files.  Have \"tail -f\" commands running\non the server.log and development.log. Rails will automatically display debugging\nand runtime information to these files. Debugging info will also be shown in the\nbrowser on requests from 127.0.0.1.\n\nYou can also log your own messages directly into the log file from your code using\nthe Ruby logger class from inside your controllers. Example:\n\n  class WeblogController < ActionController::Base\n    def destroy\n      @weblog = Weblog.find(params[:id])\n      @weblog.destroy\n      logger.info(\"#{Time.now} Destroyed Weblog ID ##{@weblog.id}!\")\n    end\n  end\n\nThe result will be a message in your log file along the lines of:\n\n  Mon Oct 08 14:22:29 +1000 2007 Destroyed Weblog ID #1\n\nMore information on how to use the logger is at http://www.ruby-doc.org/core/\n\nAlso, Ruby documentation can be found at http://www.ruby-lang.org/ including:\n\n* The Learning Ruby (Pickaxe) Book: http://www.ruby-doc.org/docs/ProgrammingRuby/\n* Learn to Program: http://pine.fm/LearnToProgram/  (a beginners guide)\n\nThese two online (and free) books will bring you up to speed on the Ruby language\nand also on programming in general.\n\n\n== Debugger\n\nDebugger support is available through the debugger command when you start your Mongrel or\nWebrick server with --debugger. This means that you can break out of execution at any point\nin the code, investigate and change the model, AND then resume execution! Example:\n\n  class WeblogController < ActionController::Base\n    def index\n      @posts = Post.find(:all)\n      debugger\n    end\n  end\n\nSo the controller will accept the action, run the first line, then present you\nwith a IRB prompt in the server window. Here you can do things like:\n\n  >> @posts.inspect\n  => \"[#<Post:0x14a6be8 @attributes={\\\"title\\\"=>nil, \\\"body\\\"=>nil, \\\"id\\\"=>\\\"1\\\"}>,\n       #<Post:0x14a6620 @attributes={\\\"title\\\"=>\\\"Rails you know!\\\", \\\"body\\\"=>\\\"Only ten..\\\", \\\"id\\\"=>\\\"2\\\"}>]\"\n  >> @posts.first.title = \"hello from a debugger\"\n  => \"hello from a debugger\"\n\n...and even better is that you can examine how your runtime objects actually work:\n\n  >> f = @posts.first\n  => #<Post:0x13630c4 @attributes={\"title\"=>nil, \"body\"=>nil, \"id\"=>\"1\"}>\n  >> f.\n  Display all 152 possibilities? (y or n)\n\nFinally, when you're ready to resume execution, you enter \"cont\"\n\n\n== Console\n\nYou can interact with the domain model by starting the console through <tt>script/console</tt>.\nHere you'll have all parts of the application configured, just like it is when the\napplication is running. You can inspect domain models, change values, and save to the\ndatabase. Starting the script without arguments will launch it in the development environment.\nPassing an argument will specify a different environment, like <tt>script/console production</tt>.\n\nTo reload your controllers and models after launching the console run <tt>reload!</tt>\n\n\n== Description of Contents\n\napp\n  Holds all the code that's specific to this particular application.\n\napp/controllers\n  Holds controllers that should be named like weblogs_controller.rb for\n  automated URL mapping. All controllers should descend from ApplicationController\n  which itself descends from ActionController::Base.\n\napp/models\n  Holds models that should be named like post.rb.\n  Most models will descend from ActiveRecord::Base.\n\napp/views\n  Holds the template files for the view that should be named like\n  weblogs/index.erb for the WeblogsController#index action. All views use eRuby\n  syntax.\n\napp/views/layouts\n  Holds the template files for layouts to be used with views. This models the common\n  header/footer method of wrapping views. In your views, define a layout using the\n  <tt>layout :default</tt> and create a file named default.erb. Inside default.erb,\n  call <% yield %> to render the view using this layout.\n\napp/helpers\n  Holds view helpers that should be named like weblogs_helper.rb. These are generated\n  for you automatically when using script/generate for controllers. Helpers can be used to\n  wrap functionality for your views into methods.\n\nconfig\n  Configuration files for the Rails environment, the routing map, the database, and other dependencies.\n\ncomponents\n  Self-contained mini-applications that can bundle together controllers, models, and views.\n\ndb\n  Contains the database schema in schema.rb.  db/migrate contains all\n  the sequence of Migrations for your schema.\n\ndoc\n  This directory is where your application documentation will be stored when generated\n  using <tt>rake doc:app</tt>\n\nlib\n  Application specific libraries. Basically, any kind of custom code that doesn't\n  belong under controllers, models, or helpers. This directory is in the load path.\n\npublic\n  The directory available for the web server. Contains subdirectories for images, stylesheets,\n  and javascripts. Also contains the dispatchers and the default HTML files. This should be\n  set as the DOCUMENT_ROOT of your web server.\n\nscript\n  Helper scripts for automation and generation.\n\ntest\n  Unit and functional tests along with fixtures. When using the script/generate scripts, template\n  test files will be generated for you and placed in this directory.\n\nvendor\n  External libraries that the application depends on. Also includes the plugins subdirectory.\n  This directory is in the load path.\n\n",

There are ways this can be potentially accounted for, but nothing is in place at the moment, causing this to be classified as a bug.\n\n* When defining a superator in a class, any operators overloaded after the superator definition will override a superator definition. For example, if you create the superator \"<---\" and then define the <() operator, the superator will not work. In this case, the superator's definition should be somewhere after the <() definition.\n\n* Superators work by handling a binary Ruby operator specially and then building a chain of unary operators after it. For this reason, a superator must match the regexp /^(\\*\\*|\\*|\\/|%|\\+|\\-|<<|>>|&|\\||\\^|<=>|>=|<=|<|>|===|==|=~)(\\-|~|\\+)+$/.\n\n== SYNOPSIS:\n\nBelow is a simple example monkey patch which adds the \"<---\" operator to all Ruby Arrays.\n\n  class Array\n    superator \"<---\" do |operand|\n      if operand.kind_of? Array\n        self + operand.map { |x| x.inspect }\n      else\n        operand.inspect\n      end\n    end\n  end\n\n== REQUIREMENTS:\n\n* Only requirement is Ruby.\n\n== INSTALL:\n\n* sudo gem install superators\n* require 'superators'\n\n== LICENSE:\n\nThis software is licensed in the public domain. You may do whatever you wish with it.\n\nYou are allowed to use this library during dodo poaching as well.\n",

    "Readme": "Methodphitamine\nThe Methodphitamine is a library for syntactically cleaner list comprehensions and an interesting approach to monads in Ruby.\nFor more information, read my blog post covering the Methodphitamine.\nCleaner Symbol#to_proc\nOne of the beautiful things the Ruby community has informally built into the language is Symbol#to_proc. The Methodphitamine takes beauty one step further.\nBelow are code examples which show the Methodphitamine's syntactical improvements over vanilla Ruby and Symbol#to_proc:\nFirst, the pure-Ruby way:\nUser.find(:all).map{|x| x.contacts.map{|y| y.last_name.capitalize }}\n\nAnd now with Symbol#to_proc:\nUser.find(:all).map{|x|x.contacts.map(&:last_name).map(&:capitalize)}\n\nAnd now with the Methodphitamine once more:\nUser.find(:all).map &its.contacts.map(&its.last_name.capitalize)\n\nNotice how even with Symbol#to_proc a block literal is still necessary because it simply can\u2019t do nested arguments. The Methodphitamine fixes this by preserving all arguments and being more readable to boot.\nNew: Monads\nYou can now do something like this:\nmy_array.maybe &it.first.reverse.upcase\n\nIf the my_array variable were equal to [\"foo\", \"bar\", \"qaz\"], the result of the expression above would be \"OOF\". However, if my_array were equal to [], the result of the expression would be nil. This maybe method will execute the chain of methods if and only if all were successful. If one failed, nil is returned.\nSo how does The Methodphitamine work?\nThe it() and its() protected methods are added to Kernel so it can be called from anywhere in a Ruby script but not on any particular Object instance. They each simply return a new It instance.\nThe It class has all instance methods stripped from it (except the ones Ruby complains about) to ensure method_missing() catches everything. In the example [1,\"2\",3].map &its.class.name, the It object first receives the class() method with no arguments via method_missing(). This gets enqueued in the @methods Array and it returns itself to receive any more methods. It then receives the next method, namely name(), and enqueues that alongside the previous method. When no more methods exist, Ruby determines if the It instance has a to_proc() method by calling respond_to?(:to_proc) so this has to be ignored and self suffices as a Ruby true boolean.\nThen the magic happens. Because map() takes a block (essentially a Proc argument), this can be substituted with a variable or method that returns a block as long as an ampersand prepends it to let the Ruby interpreter know to call to_proc() on it. The It#to_proc() method is invoked, building a custom, dynamic Proc. Because these enumerations yield a variable, the dynamic Proc is executed for each item in the collection and obj consequentially becomes a reference to the current item in the collection. We then run through the enqueued methods with inject(), passing along the return value of executing each method in the order received with arguments intact. When inject() is done, it simply returns the grand product which becomes the return value of the Proc itself. Simple, right? :)\nI chose to define both it() and its() since methods in Ruby can semantically either mean \u201cthe result of this action\u201d or the possessive \u201cthis attribute.\u201d For example, it.to_s and it.sort_by are both conceptual actions and its.class.name and its.last are both conceptual attributes.\nThe idea of an it implied block argument comes from the Groovy guys. For example, this is valid Groovy:\n[1,2,3,4].each { println it }\n\nFrom the Groovy documentation on closures, \u201cA closure always has at least one argument, which will be available within the body of the closure via the implicit parameter it if no explicit parameters are defined. The developer never has to declare the it variable \u2013 like the this parameter within objects, it is implicitly available.\u201d\n",

    "Name": "ticgit",
    "Readme": "Note: the original TicGit author has pulled all the TicGit-ng changes into his repository, creating a potentially confusing situation. The schacon TicGit repo, this one, is not consistently maintained. For up to date TicGit-ng info and code, check the canonical TicGit-ng repository at\nhttps://github.com/jeffWelling/ticgit\nTicGit-ng\nThis project provides a ticketing system built on Git that is kept in a\nseparate branch in your projects Git repository. Originally called TicGit,\nit is now known as TicGit-ng to continue development and avoid namespace\nclashes.\nAbout\nTicGit-ng is a simple ticketing system, roughly similar to the Lighthouse model, that is based in git. It provides a command line client that uses the \u2018git\u2019 gem to keep its ticketing information in a separate branch (called \u2018ticgit-ng\u2019) within your existing git repository. All the data is file based and rarely changing, decreasing the likelihood of a merge issue. Right now, ticket branch merges need to be done manually and separately, but work is being done on a ti sync command to make this easier and more intuitive.\nThe idea is that it keeps your tickets in the same repository, but without mucking up your working tree. By using its own seperate branch to store its information it keeps the working trees in all your other branches untouched.\nThere are two interfaces available, the command line ti command and the ticgitweb web interface, though ticgitweb has many more prerequisites than ti.\nIt will automatically create the new branch the first time you use it, and it caches all the data (another working directory and index file) in your ~/.ticgit-ng directory by default. If you delete that directory, it will just create it again the next time, you will lose no data (except some of your saved preferences).\nTicGit-ng is currently using itself to store its feature requests and bug reports.\nPrerequisites\nThere are two sets of prerequisites, those for people who intend to just run ti, and another set for those who wish to run ticgitweb as well. ticgitweb has additional dependancies that aren't required for ti's use.\nti\nRequired Packages: git, ruby, rubygems\nRequired Ruby Gems: git\nTo install these packages on a Debian system, or a Debian based system like Ubuntu, do\nsudo aptitude install git ruby rubygems\nsudo gem install git\n\nticgitweb\nRequired Packages: git, ruby, rubygems\nRequired Ruby Gems: git, sinatra, haml, sass\nTo install these packages on a Debian system, or a Debian based system like Ubuntu, do\nsudo aptitude install git ruby rubygems\nsudo gem install git sinatra haml sass\n\nA Note about rubygems\nWhile the version of rubygems available from the repositories on Debian 5.0.5 stable will work just fine for using the command line ti program, using ticgitweb requires some extra effort.\nOlder versions of rubygems, such as the one available on Debian 5.0.5, will not work out of the box with the new gem repositories because the .deb in stable relies on rubyforge rather than rubygems for its operations. See this bug for an example. If you are running an older version of rubygems, you may need to get the latest rubygems package from http://rubygems.org/ or apt pinning before being able to properly install the git and ticgit gems.\nA Note about the git gem\nThe git gem requires a git version of 1.6.0.0 or later, but on Debian stable, git-core is currently (Sept 6th 2010) at 1.5.6.5.  This isn't a fatal problem and we can continue using version 1.5.6.5 with the git gem, but you will see notices like this if you do\n[WARNING] The git gem requires git 1.6.0.0 or later, but only found 1.5.6.5. You should probably upgrade.\nPlease specify at least one action to execute.\n\nIf these annoy you as they do me and you've set up apt pinning, you can do\n$ sudo aptitude -t testing install git-core\n\nAnd those notices should go away.\nInstalling\nInstallation on a Debian stable system.  Note that the command line interface for TicGit-ng can be run from Debian stable, but some of the gems required for the web interface may require you to use apt pinning to run without errors.  See below\nTo install TicGit-ng on your system, you can go one of two ways,\n$ gem install TicGit-ng\n\nor, you can install it from source by downloading this repository building your own gem (see below).\nUsage\nTo get a list of all commands with short description:\n> ti --help\nUsage: ti COMMAND [FLAGS] [ARGS]\n\nOptions for help command:\n\nThe available TicGit-ng commands are:\n    recent                           List recent activities\n    checkout                         Checkout a ticket\n    tag                              Modify tags of a ticket\n    comment                          Comment on a ticket\n    milestone                        List and modify milestones\n    assign                           Assings a ticket to someone\n    points                           Assign points to a ticket\n    state                            Change state of a ticket\n    show                             Show a ticket\n    new                              Create a new ticket\n    attach                           Attach file to ticket\n    list                             List tickets\n\nCommon options:\n    -v, --version                    Show the version number\n    -h, --help                       Display this help\n\"help\" is not a command\n\nTo get help about a specific command:\n> ti <command> --help\n## for example\n> ti assign --help\nUsage: ti assign [options] [ticket_id]\n\nOptions for assign command:\n    -c, --checkout TICKET            Checkout this ticket\n    -u, --user USER                  Assign the ticket to this user\n\nCommon options:\n    -v, --version                    Show the version number\n    -h, --help                       Display this help\n\nThe available commands are:\nti list     - show all tickets\nti show     - show details of a specific ticket\nti new      - create a new ticket\nti checkout - checkout a ticket\nti state    - change a ticket state (open, resolved, invalid, hold)\nti comment  - add a comment to a ticket\nti tag      - add or delete a tag from a ticket\nti assign   - change to whom a ticket is assigned\n\nUsage Examples\nThe first time you use any command in Ticgit-ng, it will create a new branch in your repo called \u2018ticgit-ng\u2019 and setup a caching area in ~/.ticgit-ng.\nIf you run it without arguments, it will tell you what is available to run\n$ ti\nPlease specify at least one action to execute.\n\nUsage: ti COMMAND [FLAGS] [ARGS]\n\nThe available TicGit-ng commands are:\n    recent                           List recent activities\n    checkout                         Checkout a ticket\n    tag                              Modify tags of a ticket\n    comment                          Comment on a ticket\n    milestone                        List and modify milestones\n    assign                           Assings a ticket to someone\n    points                           Assign points to a ticket\n    state                            Change state of a ticket\n    show                             Show a ticket\n    new                              Create a new ticket\n    attach                           Attach file to ticket\n    list                             List tickets\n\nCommon options:\n    -v, --version                    Show the version number\n    -h, --help                       Display this help\n\nThe first time you run ti list, it will show an empty list.\n$ ti list\nI, [2010-09-06T15:47:52.075485 #4820]  INFO -- : creating ticgit repo branch\n\n   TicId  Title                             State Date  Assgn    Tags                \n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nTo add a new ticket you can use ti new -t 'Title of ticket' and give it a title in one command line.\n$ ti new -t 'my new ticket'\n$ ti list\n\n   TicId  Title                             State Date  Assgn    Tags                \n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n   d7f2d8 my new ticket                     open  09/06 \n\nFor the \u2018comment\u2019 and \u2018new\u2019 commands, if you don\u2019t specify a \u2018-m\u2019 for the message, it puts you into $EDITOR  to write it.

Now you can see, out ti state hold command changed the state of that ticket to on hold. This can also be done without checking out the ticket by using ti state 1 hold.\nWhere ticgit expects a ticket id, it will take either the number of the ticket on the last \u2018list\u2019 you did, or it will take the partial sha each ticket is assigned when it is created \u2013 that number never changes for the life of the ticket, even across repositories, so you can email that number to someone else working on the project so they can identify it. If nothing is specified, it will use the currently checked out ticket.\n$ ti comment -m \"I'm a new comment\"\n$ ti show\nTitle: my new ticket\nTicId: d7f2d8f6d6ec3da1a1800a33fb090d590a533bac\n\nAssigned: jeff.welling@gmail.com\nOpened: Mon Sep 06 15:52:03 -0700 2010 (0 days)\nState: OPEN\nPoints: no estimate\nTags: bug\n\nComments (1):\n  * Added 09/06 18:34 by jeff.welling@gmail.com\n  I'm a new comment\n\nti show also has a '-f' argument to be able to see comments that are longer than 3 lines, which would normally be truncated.\nThe ti list command can also be sorted and filtered.\n$ ti list --help\nUsage: ti list [options]\n\nOptions for list command:\n    -l, --list                       Show the saved queries\n    -S, --saveas SAVENAME            Save this list as a saved name\n    -a, --assigned ASSIGNED          List only tickets assigned to someone\n    -s, --states STATE[,STATE]       List only tickets in a specific state(s)\n                                     Prefix the state with '-' to negate\n    -t, --tags TAG[,TAG]             List only tickets with specific tag(s)\n                                     Prefix the tag with '-' to negate\n    -o, --order ORDER                Field to order by - one of : assigned,state,date,title\n\nCommon options:\n    -v, --version                    Show the version number\n    -h, --help                       Display this help\n\nSo if you wanted to see a list of all your tickets that have the \u2018feature\u2019 tag, assigned to \u2018jeff.welling@gmail.com\u2019 and are \u2018open\u2019, ordered by date opened descending, and save that view as \u2018not_mine\u2019, you can run this:\n$ ti list -t feature -s open -a jeff.welling@gmail.com -o date.desc -S not_mine\n\nThen if you want to later list tickets with the same options as you used above, use\n$ ti list not_mine\n\nCollaboration\nIf you have cloned a repository and would like to get the ticgit-ng branch for that repo (presuming they have one), do this.\n$git branch ticgit-ng origin/ticgit-ng\n\nThis will create a ticgit-ng branch in your local repo based on the ticgit-ng branch in origin.  Now you can run ti list and it will show you the ticgit-ng tickets for that repository.\nGetting the TicGit-ng ticgit-ng branch\nTo download your own copy of the TicGit-ng ticgit branch after cloning the repo, so that you can add or alter a bug yourself, follow these instructions.\nThis will checkout a ticgit-ng branch and set it to track the ticgit-ng branch upstream in origin, and then checks out the master branch.  You must checkout the master branch because TicGit-ng gets confused if you are already in the ticgit-ng branch when running TicGit-ng.\n$ git checkout origin/ticgit-ng\n$ git checkout -b ticgit-ng\n$ git checkout master\n\nThis will show you all of the bugs in TicGit-ng's ticgit-ng branch.\n$ ti list\n\nTo submit your changes back to the upstream maintainer, push the bugs in your ticgit-ng branch to your public repo on Github\n$ git push origin ticgit-ng\n\nThen contact the upstream maintainer by sending a Pull Request or Email and ask them to review and accept your bug changes.\nSharing your tickets with others\nSharing your ticgit tickets with other people is as easy as asking them either creating their ticgit-ng branch based on yours if they haven't already started their own ticgit-ng branch, or pulling your ticgit-ng branch into theirs.\nIf you host your repositories on Github as I do then this process is simplified some because you don't have to worry about hosting your repository somewhere where other people can access it to pull your ticgit-ng branch.\nFor example, when I want my friend wnight to have the changes I made to my tickets in my ticgit-ng repository, I do a\n$ git push origin\n\nto update all my remote branches with my current ones, and then I ask him to do a\n$ git checkout ticgit-ng\n$ git pull git@github.com:jeffWelling/ticgit.git ticgit-ng\n$ git checkout master\n\nto pull my changes into his ticgit-ng branch and then switch back to his master branch.  Now when he does ti list it will show the changes I made to the tickets on my system.\nIncorporating other peoples changes into your ticgit-ng branch\nThe process is much the same as above, except the rolls are reversed.  Once you know they have published their changes and you have a URL to do a git pull from, you simply do\n$ git checkout ticgit-ng\n$ git pull SOURCE_URL ticgit-ng\n$ git checkout master\n\nReplacing SOURCE_URL with the URL you were told to pull from, now you can see the changes they made, in your ticgit-ng branch.  You can easily publish these changes with a git push origin so anyone following your work can also see these changes.\nNext generation collaboration\nChanges made by Bruno Santos to add a ti sync command were integrated on February 15th 2011.  You can now use the ti sync [options] command to sync your tickets with anyone else you've added with git remote add.  To use ti sync, all you need to do is first make sure you've already added the remote source with git remote add, and then do\n$ ti sync --repo REMOTE_SOURCE\n\nif you want to pull their tickets into your ticgit-ng branch and push your tickets to their ticgit-ng branch, or\n$ ti sync --repo REMOTE_SOURCE --no-push\n\nif you want to pull their tickets into your ticgit-ng branch without pushing your tickets to their branch.\nMore information on using ti sync can be gleemed from reviewing the merge specs\nTicgitweb\nTo run the Sinatra enabled web UI for your TicGit-ng repo, simply cd to your repository and run 'ticgitweb', or 'ticgitweb -p 3456' to change the port to something other than '4567', which is the Sinatra default.\nHere is what the Ticket listing looks like:\n\nAnd here is an individual ticket:\n\nDevelopment\nThe original author had used rspec to write specs for ticgit-ng, but one of the maintainers since then switched it over to bacon[1][2][3] and I haven't been too inclined to switch it back.\nPrerequisites\nTo install the prerequisites on Debian stable for testing ticgit-ng, you will need apt pinning.\n$ sudo aptitude -t testing install rubygems rake\n$ sudo gem install yard bacon\n\nI pull rubygems from testing to avoid a problem with gherkin creating a syntactically incorrect gemspec which makes a lot of noise whenever gem is called. I ran into a problem when gem was installing yard, it had a problem with the documentation but thankfully the error wasn't fatal and was only about not being able to compile the documentation which I don't use, so it continued without trouble.\nHow To Test\nTo test your version of ticgit-ng, go to your ticgit-ng directory and run\nrake bacon\n\nHow to generate a gem from your development copy of ticgit-ng\nTo create a gem from your development copy of ticgit-ng, go to your ticgit-ng directory and do\nrake gem\n\nThis will create a pkg/ directory, which will contain a newly created ticgit-ng gem for you to install.\nMore information on developing TicGit-ng and collaborating with other TicGit-ng developers at here\nMore information on developing TicGit-ng and collaborating with other TicGit-ng developers at here\nAlternatives\nditz \nbugs everywhere\ngit-issues\nAuthors\nOriginal Author:\nScott Chacon                (schacon@gmail.com)\nCurrent Active Maintainer:\nJeff Welling                (jeff.welling@gmail.com)\nFor a detailed list of contributors, use git log.\n",

    "Readme": "QuickTicket\nQuickTicket is a Rails plugin that utilizes the Lighthouse API to provide ticket creation within a Rails application. This will create a little icon on the bottom right of the application screen (which scrolls) that will display a pane when clicked. This will allow the user to provide their comments/issues/bug into  the pane which is then submitted to your Lighthouse account for the project.\nWhat gets installed\nOnce you have the plugin installed, you will find the following two new assets created into your application\n\n./public/stylesheets/quickticket.css - This holds the default (and configurable) styling for the application, update it as you see fit or configure it not to be loaded.\n./public/javascripts/quickticket.js  - This holds the necessary javascript, written to work with the Prototype library. You can enhance or modify it (switch to jQuery) but keep the namespace and methods the same.\n\nAlso new parameters have been added to your environment.rb file which will allow you to configure QuickTicket. You should probably go update those now, otherwise it will act like its working, but fail.\nWhat you need to do\nIt feels dirty adding routes to your application, so we are just going to make you do it. This route will just allow the app to call back into the lighthouse ticket controller, which IF the environment is correct, will execute, otherwise it will redirect back. Essentially said, if someone tries to access the route when not in the right environment, the system will block it (p0wn3d). So make sure you add this line to your routes.rb file:\nmap.create_ticket \"create_ticket\", :controller=>\"quick_tickets\", :action=>\"create\"\n",

    "Name": "attachment_fu",
    "Readme": "attachment-fu\n=============\n\nattachment_fu is a plugin by Rick Olson (aka technoweenie <http://techno-weenie.net>) and is the successor to acts_as_attachment.  To get a basic run-through of its capabilities, check out Mike Clark's tutorial <http://clarkware.com/cgi/blosxom/2007/02/24#FileUploadFu>.\n\n\nattachment_fu functionality\n===========================\n\nattachment_fu facilitates file uploads in Ruby on Rails.  There are a few storage options for the actual file data, but the plugin always at a minimum stores metadata for each file in the database.\n\nThere are three storage options for files uploaded through attachment_fu:\n  File system\n  Database file\n  Amazon S3\n\nEach method of storage many options associated with it that will be covered in the following section.  Something to note, however, is that the Amazon S3 storage requires you to modify config/amazon_s3.yml and the Database file storage requires an extra table.\n\n\nattachment_fu models\n====================\n\nFor all three of these storage options a table of metadata is required.  This table will contain information about the file (hence the 'meta') and its location.  This table has no restrictions on naming, unlike the extra table required for database storage, which must have a table name of db_files (and by convention a model of DbFile).\n\nIn the model there are two methods made available by this plugins: has_attachment and validates_as_attachment.\n\nhas_attachment(options = {})\n  This method accepts the options in a hash:\n    :content_type     # Allowed content types.\n                      # Allows all by default.  Use :image to allow all standard image types.\n    :min_size         # Minimum size allowed.\n                      # 1 byte is the default.\n    :max_size         # Maximum size allowed.\n                      # 1.megabyte is the default.\n    :size             # Range of sizes allowed.\n                      # (1..1.megabyte) is the default.  This overrides the :min_size and :max_size options.\n    :resize_to        # Used by RMagick to resize images.\n                      # Pass either an array of width/height, or a geometry string.\n    :thumbnails       # Specifies a set of thumbnails to generate.\n                      # This accepts a hash of filename suffixes and RMagick resizing options.\n                      # This option need only be included if you want thumbnailing.\n    :thumbnail_class  # Set which model class to use for thumbnails.\n                      # This current attachment class is used by default.\n    :path_prefix      # path to store the uploaded files.\n                      # Uses public/#{table_name} by default for the filesystem, and just #{table_name} for the S3 backend.  \n                      # Setting this sets the :storage to :file_system.\n    :storage          # Specifies the storage system to use..\n                      # Defaults to :db_file.  Options are :file_system, :db_file, and :s3.\n    :processor        # Sets the image processor to use for resizing of the attached image.\n                      # Options include ImageScience, Rmagick, and MiniMagick.  Default is whatever is installed.\n\n\n  Examples:\n    has_attachment :max_size => 1.kilobyte\n    has_attachment :size => 1.megabyte..2.megabytes\n    has_attachment :content_type => 'application/pdf'\n    has_attachment :content_type => ['application/pdf', 'application/msword', 'text/plain']\n    has_attachment :content_type => :image, :resize_to => [50,50]\n    has_attachment :content_type => ['application/pdf', :image], :resize_to => 'x50'\n    has_attachment :thumbnails => { :thumb => [50, 50], :geometry => 'x50' }\n    has_attachment :storage => :file_system, :path_prefix => 'public/files'\n    has_attachment :storage => :file_system, :path_prefix => 'public/files', \n                   :content_type => :image, :resize_to => [50,50]\n    has_attachment :storage => :file_system, :path_prefix => 'public/files',\n                   :thumbnails => { :thumb => [50, 50], :geometry => 'x50' }\n    has_attachment :storage => :s3\n\nvalidates_as_attachment\n  This method prevents files outside of the valid range (:min_size to :max_size, or the :size range) from being saved.  It does not however, halt the upload of such files.  They will be uploaded into memory regardless of size before validation.\n\n  Example:\n    validates_as_attachment\n\n\nattachment_fu migrations\n========================\n\nFields for attachment_fu metadata tables...\n  in general:\n    size,         :integer  # file size in bytes\n    content_type, :string   # mime type, ex: application/mp3\n    filename,     :string   # sanitized filename\n  that reference images:\n    height,       :integer  # in pixels\n    width,        :integer  # in pixels\n  that reference images that will be thumbnailed:\n    parent_id,    :integer  # id of parent image (on the same table, a self-referencing foreign-key).\n                            # Only populated if the current object is a thumbnail.\n    thumbnail,    :string   # the 'type' of thumbnail this attachment record describes.  \n                            # Only populated if the current object is a thumbnail.\n                            # Usage:\n                            # [ In Model 'Avatar' ]\n                            #   has_attachment :content_type => :image, \n                            #                  :storage => :file_system, \n                            #                  :max_size => 500.kilobytes,\n                            #                  :resize_to => '320x200>',\n                            #                  :thumbnails => { :small => '10x10>',\n                            #                                   :thumb => '100x100>' }\n                            # [ Elsewhere ]\n                            # @user.avatar.thumbnails.first.thumbnail #=> 'small'\n  that reference files stored in the database (:db_file):\n    db_file_id,   :integer  # id of the file in the database (foreign key)\n\nField for attachment_fu db_files table:\n  data, :binary # binary file data, for use in database file storage\n\n\nattachment_fu views\n===================\n\nThere are two main views tasks that will be directly affected by attachment_fu: upload forms and displaying uploaded images.\n\nThere are two parts of the upload form that differ from typical usage.\n  1. Include ':multipart => true' in the html options of the form_for tag.\n    Example:\n      <% form_for(:attachment_metadata, :url => { :action => \"create\" }, :html => { :multipart => true }) do |form| %>\n\n  2. Use the file_field helper with :uploaded_data as the field name.\n    Example:\n      <%= form.file_field :uploaded_data %>\n\nDisplaying uploaded images is made easy by the public_filename method of the ActiveRecord attachment objects using file system and s3 storage.\n\npublic_filename(thumbnail = nil)\n  Returns the public path to the file.  If a thumbnail prefix is specified it will return the public file path to the corresponding thumbnail.\n  Examples:\n    attachment_obj.public_filename          #=> /attachments/2/file.jpg\n    attachment_obj.public_filename(:thumb)  #=> /attachments/2/file_thumb.jpg\n    attachment_obj.public_filename(:small)  #=> /attachments/2/file_small.jpg\n\nWhen serving files from database storage, doing more than simply downloading the file is beyond the scope of this document.\n\n\nattachment_fu controllers\n=========================\n\nThere are two considerations to take into account when using attachment_fu in controllers.\n\nThe first is when the files have no publicly accessible path and need to be downloaded through an action.\n\nExample:\n  def readme\n    send_file '/path/to/readme.txt', :type => 'plain/text', :disposition => 'inline'\n  end\n\nSee the possible values for send_file for reference.\n\n\nThe second is when saving the file when submitted from a form.\nExample in view:\n <%= form.file_field :attachable, :uploaded_data %>\n\nExample in controller:\n  def create\n    @attachable_file = AttachmentMetadataModel.new(params[:attachable])\n    if @attachable_file.save\n      flash[:notice] = 'Attachment was successfully created.'\n      redirect_to attachable_url(@attachable_file)     \n    else\n      render :action => :new\n    end\n  end\n\n",

The file is normally copied over by the plugin installation process, but if it doesn't make it there you can move it by hand.\n\nExample\n=======\n\nSay you're browsing your site and you get a 500 error on /users/new, which is rendering the UsersController#new action. In the error page (or exception email, if you're using ExceptionNotifier), Laziness adds something like the following:\n\ndef test_get_users_new_should_not_raise_nameerror_exception\n  assert_nothing_raised(NameError) do\n    get :new, {[params from request]}, {[session from request]}, {[flash from request]}\n  end\nend\n\nThe exact exception asserted (in this case, NameError) will depend on what caused the 500 error in the first place.\n\nIf you're using RSpec, the generated code will look like this:\n\ndescribe \"Handling GET users new\" do\n  it \"should not raise NameError\" do\n    lambda { \n      get :new, {[params from request]}, {[session from request]}, {[flash from request]}\n    }.should_not raise_error(NameError)\n  end\nend\n\nCatching Specific Exceptions\n============================\n\nYou can customize the tests to be generated on an exception-by-exception basis; just add the appropriate file to lib/exceptions/what/ever.rb and make sure it defines ++test++ and ++spec++ methods; look at lib/exceptions/action_controller/unknown_view.rb for an example.\n\n\nCopyright (c) 2008 Ben Scofield, released under the MIT license\n\n",

{
    "Name": "acctsoft",
    "Readme": "== Welcome to Rails\n\nRails is a web-application and persistence framework that includes everything\nneeded to create database-backed web-applications according to the\nModel-View-Control pattern of separation. This pattern splits the view (also\ncalled the presentation) into \"dumb\" templates that are primarily responsible\nfor inserting pre-built data in between HTML tags. The model contains the\n\"smart\" domain objects (such as Account, Product, Person, Post) that holds all\nthe business logic and knows how to persist themselves to a database. The\ncontroller handles the incoming requests (such as Save New Account, Update\nProduct, Show Post) by manipulating the model and directing data to the view.\n\nIn Rails, the model is handled by what's called an object-relational mapping\nlayer entitled Active Record. This layer allows you to present the data from\ndatabase rows as objects and embellish these data objects with business logic\nmethods. You can read more about Active Record in \nlink:files/vendor/rails/activerecord/README.html.\n\nThe controller and view are handled by the Action Pack, which handles both\nlayers by its two parts: Action View and Action Controller. These two layers\nare bundled in a single package due to their heavy interdependence. This is\nunlike the relationship between the Active Record and Action Pack that is much\nmore separate. Each of these packages can be used independently outside of\nRails.  You can read more about Action Pack in \nlink:files/vendor/rails/actionpack/README.html.\n\n\n== Getting started\n\n1. Run the WEBrick servlet: <tt>ruby script/server</tt> (run with --help for options)\n   ...or if you have lighttpd installed: <tt>ruby script/lighttpd</tt> (it's faster)\n2. Go to http://localhost:3000/ and get \"Congratulations, you've put Ruby on Rails!\"\n3. Follow the guidelines on the \"Congratulations, you've put Ruby on Rails!\" screen\n\n\n== Example for Apache conf\n\n  <VirtualHost *:80>\n    ServerName rails\n    DocumentRoot /path/application/public/\n    ErrorLog /path/application/log/server.log\n\n    <Directory /path/application/public/>\n      Options ExecCGI FollowSymLinks\n      AllowOverride all\n      Allow from all\n      Order allow,deny\n    </Directory>\n  </VirtualHost>\n\nNOTE: Be sure that CGIs can be executed in that directory as well. So ExecCGI\nshould be on and \".cgi\" should respond. All requests from 127.0.0.1 go\nthrough CGI, so no Apache restart is necessary for changes. All other requests\ngo through FCGI (or mod_ruby), which requires a restart to show changes.\n\n\n== Debugging Rails\n\nHave \"tail -f\" commands running on both the server.log, production.log, and\ntest.log files. Rails will automatically display debugging and runtime\ninformation to these files. Debugging info will also be shown in the browser\non requests from 127.0.0.1.\n\n\n== Breakpoints\n\nBreakpoint support is available through the script/breakpointer client. This\nmeans that you can break out of execution at any point in the code, investigate\nand change the model, AND then resume execution! Example:\n\n  class WeblogController < ActionController::Base\n    def index\n      @posts = Post.find_all\n      breakpoint \"Breaking out from the list\"\n    end\n  end\n\nSo the controller will accept the action, run the first line, then present you\nwith a IRB prompt in the breakpointer window. Here you can do things like:\n\nExecuting breakpoint \"Breaking out from the list\" at .../webrick_server.rb:16 in 'breakpoint'\n\n  >> @posts.inspect\n  => \"[#<Post:0x14a6be8 @attributes={\\\"title\\\"=>nil, \\\"body\\\"=>nil, \\\"id\\\"=>\\\"1\\\"}>, \n       #<Post:0x14a6620 @attributes={\\\"title\\\"=>\\\"Rails you know!\\\", \\\"body\\\"=>\\\"Only ten..\\\", \\\"id\\\"=>\\\"2\\\"}>]\"\n  >> @posts.first.title = \"hello from a breakpoint\"\n  => \"hello from a breakpoint\"\n\n...and even better is that you can examine how your runtime objects actually work:\n\n  >> f = @posts.first \n  => #<Post:0x13630c4 @attributes={\"title\"=>nil, \"body\"=>nil, \"id\"=>\"1\"}>\n  >> f.\n  Display all 152 possibilities? (y or n)\n\nFinally, when you're ready to resume execution, you press CTRL-D\n\n\n== Console\n\nYou can interact with the domain model by starting the console through script/console. \nHere you'll have all parts of the application configured, just like it is when the\napplication is running. You can inspect domain models, change values, and save to the\ndatabase. Starting the script without arguments will launch it in the development environment.\nPassing an argument will specify a different environment, like <tt>console production</tt>.\n\n\n== Description of contents\n\napp\n  Holds all the code that's specific to this particular application.\n\napp/controllers\n  Holds controllers that should be named like weblog_controller.rb for\n  automated URL mapping. All controllers should descend from\n  ActionController::Base.\n\napp/models\n  Holds models that should be named like post.rb.\n  Most models will descend from ActiveRecord::Base.\n\napp/views\n  Holds the template files for the view that should be named like\n  weblog/index.rhtml for the WeblogController#index action. All views use eRuby\n  syntax. This directory can also be used to keep stylesheets, images, and so on\n  that can be symlinked to public.\n\napp/helpers\n  Holds view helpers that should be named like weblog_helper.rb.\n\nconfig\n  Configuration files for the Rails environment, the routing map, the database, and other dependencies.\n\ncomponents\n  Self-contained mini-applications that can bundle together controllers, models, and views.\n\nlib\n  Application specific libraries.

The solution is to do something like this:\n\n<tt>\n<r:capture_headers>\n  <rr:table_of_contents/>\n\n<r:h1>Foo</r:h1>\n\n...\n\n<r:h2>Bar</r:h2>\n\n...\n\n</r:capture_headers>\n</tt>\n\n(A fuller example of this same tag is laid out in spec/models/page_with_rerender_text_spec.rb.)\n\nThe <tt><rr:toc/></tt> tag is in a separate namespace than the others and thus won't be evaluated until afterward.  In the <tt><r:capture_headers/></tt> tag we call\n\n<tt>rerender_text(tag.expand, :headers => headers)</tt>\n\nwhich sets up a new Radius context and parser to expand tags in the \"rr\" namespace.\n\n== Using other namespaces\n\nIf you need to render more than twice, you can change the namespace used for a particular parser and context using the <tt>rerender_with_namespace(text, namespace, options)</tt> method.\n\n== <r:rerender>\n\nThis extension includes one tag that acts as a basic rerenderer.  Sometimes the tag that contains a rerenderable tag doesn't need to do anything but call it with the correct namespace due to the fact that tags may have side-effects.  For example, the example above can be\n\n<tt>\n<r:rerender>\n  <rr:table_of_contents/>\n\n<r:h1>Foo</r:h1>\n\n...\n\n<r:h2>Bar</r:h2>\n\n...\n\n</r:rerender>\n</tt>\n\n...as long as the <r:hx> tags add effect an instance variable of the page that's accessible to tag.globals.page.\n",

    "Name": "alfarrubyo",
    "Readme": "== Welcome to Rails\n\nRails is a web-application and persistence framework that includes everything\nneeded to create database-backed web-applications according to the\nModel-View-Control pattern of separation. This pattern splits the view (also\ncalled the presentation) into \"dumb\" templates that are primarily responsible\nfor inserting pre-built data in between HTML tags. The model contains the\n\"smart\" domain objects (such as Account, Product, Person, Post) that holds all\nthe business logic and knows how to persist themselves to a database. The\ncontroller handles the incoming requests (such as Save New Account, Update\nProduct, Show Post) by manipulating the model and directing data to the view.\n\nIn Rails, the model is handled by what's called an object-relational mapping\nlayer entitled Active Record. This layer allows you to present the data from\ndatabase rows as objects and embellish these data objects with business logic\nmethods. You can read more about Active Record in\nlink:files/vendor/rails/activerecord/README.html.\n\nThe controller and view are handled by the Action Pack, which handles both\nlayers by its two parts: Action View and Action Controller. These two layers\nare bundled in a single package due to their heavy interdependence. This is\nunlike the relationship between the Active Record and Action Pack that is much\nmore separate. Each of these packages can be used independently outside of\nRails.  You can read more about Action Pack in\nlink:files/vendor/rails/actionpack/README.html.\n\n\n== Getting Started\n\n1. At the command prompt, start a new Rails application using the <tt>rails</tt> command\n   and your application name. Ex: rails myapp\n   (If you've downloaded Rails in a complete tgz or zip, this step is already done)\n2. Change directory into myapp and start the web server: <tt>script/server</tt> (run with --help for options)\n3. Go to http://localhost:3000/ and get \"Welcome aboard: You\u2019re riding the Rails!\"\n4. Follow the guidelines to start developing your application\n\n\n== Web Servers\n\nBy default, Rails will try to use Mongrel and lighttpd if they are installed, otherwise\nRails will use WEBrick, the webserver that ships with Ruby. When you run script/server,\nRails will check if Mongrel exists, then lighttpd and finally fall back to WEBrick. This ensures\nthat you can always get up and running quickly.\n\nMongrel is a Ruby-based webserver with a C component (which requires compilation) that is\nsuitable for development and deployment of Rails applications. If you have Ruby Gems installed,\ngetting up and running with mongrel is as easy as: <tt>gem install mongrel</tt>.\nMore info at: http://mongrel.rubyforge.org\n\nIf Mongrel is not installed, Rails will look for lighttpd. It's considerably faster than\nMongrel and WEBrick and also suited for production use, but requires additional\ninstallation and currently only works well on OS X/Unix (Windows users are encouraged\nto start with Mongrel). We recommend version 1.4.11 and higher. You can download it from\nhttp://www.lighttpd.net.\n\nAnd finally, if neither Mongrel or lighttpd are installed, Rails will use the built-in Ruby\nweb server, WEBrick. WEBrick is a small Ruby web server suitable for development, but not\nfor production.\n\nBut of course its also possible to run Rails on any platform that supports FCGI.\nApache, LiteSpeed, IIS are just a few. For more information on FCGI,\nplease visit: http://wiki.rubyonrails.com/rails/pages/FastCGI\n\n\n== Debugging Rails\n\nSometimes your application goes wrong.  Fortunately there are a lot of tools that\nwill help you debug it and get it back on the rails.\n\nFirst area to check is the application log files.  Have \"tail -f\" commands running\non the server.log and development.log. Rails will automatically display debugging\nand runtime information to these files. Debugging info will also be shown in the\nbrowser on requests from 127.0.0.1.\n\nYou can also log your own messages directly into the log file from your code using\nthe Ruby logger class from inside your controllers. Example:\n\n  class WeblogController < ActionController::Base\n    def destroy\n      @weblog = Weblog.find(params[:id])\n      @weblog.destroy\n      logger.info(\"#{Time.now} Destroyed Weblog ID ##{@weblog.id}!\")\n    end\n  end\n\nThe result will be a message in your log file along the lines of:\n\n  Mon Oct 08 14:22:29 +1000 2007 Destroyed Weblog ID #1\n\nMore information on how to use the logger is at http://www.ruby-doc.org/core/\n\nAlso, Ruby documentation can be found at http://www.ruby-lang.org/ including:\n\n* The Learning Ruby (Pickaxe) Book: http://www.ruby-doc.org/docs/ProgrammingRuby/\n* Learn to Program: http://pine.fm/LearnToProgram/  (a beginners guide)\n\nThese two online (and free) books will bring you up to speed on the Ruby language\nand also on programming in general.\n\n\n== Debugger\n\nDebugger support is available through the debugger command when you start your Mongrel or\nWebrick server with --debugger. This means that you can break out of execution at any point\nin the code, investigate and change the model, AND then resume execution! Example:\n\n  class WeblogController < ActionController::Base\n    def index\n      @posts = Post.find(:all)\n      debugger\n    end\n  end\n\nSo the controller will accept the action, run the first line, then present you\nwith a IRB prompt in the server window. Here you can do things like:\n\n  >> @posts.inspect\n  => \"[#<Post:0x14a6be8 @attributes={\\\"title\\\"=>nil, \\\"body\\\"=>nil, \\\"id\\\"=>\\\"1\\\"}>,\n       #<Post:0x14a6620 @attributes={\\\"title\\\"=>\\\"Rails you know!\\\", \\\"body\\\"=>\\\"Only ten..\\\", \\\"id\\\"=>\\\"2\\\"}>]\"\n  >> @posts.first.title = \"hello from a debugger\"\n  => \"hello from a debugger\"\n\n...and even better is that you can examine how your runtime objects actually work:\n\n  >> f = @posts.first\n  => #<Post:0x13630c4 @attributes={\"title\"=>nil, \"body\"=>nil, \"id\"=>\"1\"}>\n  >> f.\n  Display all 152 possibilities? (y or n)\n\nFinally, when you're ready to resume execution, you enter \"cont\"\n\n\n== Console\n\nYou can interact with the domain model by starting the console through <tt>script/console</tt>.\nHere you'll have all parts of the application configured, just like it is when the\napplication is running. You can inspect domain models, change values, and save to the\ndatabase. Starting the script without arguments will launch it in the development environment.\nPassing an argument will specify a different environment, like <tt>script/console production</tt>.\n\nTo reload your controllers and models after launching the console run <tt>reload!</tt>\n\n\n== Description of Contents\n\napp\n  Holds all the code that's specific to this particular application.\n\napp/controllers\n  Holds controllers that should be named like weblogs_controller.rb for\n  automated URL mapping. All controllers should descend from ApplicationController\n  which itself descends from ActionController::Base.\n\napp/models\n  Holds models that should be named like post.rb.\n  Most models will descend from ActiveRecord::Base.\n\napp/views\n  Holds the template files for the view that should be named like\n  weblogs/index.erb for the WeblogsController#index action. All views use eRuby\n  syntax.\n\napp/views/layouts\n  Holds the template files for layouts to be used with views. This models the common\n  header/footer method of wrapping views. In your views, define a layout using the\n  <tt>layout :default</tt> and create a file named default.erb. Inside default.erb,\n  call <% yield %> to render the view using this layout.\n\napp/helpers\n  Holds view helpers that should be named like weblogs_helper.rb. These are generated\n  for you automatically when using script/generate for controllers. Helpers can be used to\n  wrap functionality for your views into methods.\n\nconfig\n  Configuration files for the Rails environment, the routing map, the database, and other dependencies.\n\ndb\n  Contains the database schema in schema.rb.  db/migrate contains all\n  the sequence of Migrations for your schema.\n\ndoc\n  This directory is where your application documentation will be stored when generated\n  using <tt>rake doc:app</tt>\n\nlib\n  Application specific libraries.

    "Readme": "= Curies\n\n* http://curies.rubyforge.org\n\n== DESCRIPTION:\n\nThe Curies library implements the CURIE syntax for expressing Compact URIs.  \n\nIn a nutshell, a CURIE is a compact way of representing a URI.  For example, suppose you've got an XML document in which \nyou'll be writing many attributes of the form \"http://www.amazon.com/?isbn=123478753\".  With a CURIE, you can represent those as\n\"[amazon:123478753]\" where \"amazon\" is a registered prefix in your document.\n\nThis library is small, but useful if you're writing a parser for a language that uses CURIEs.  \nI wrote it because I'm implementing an RDF/JSON library and, because the RDF/JSON spec isn't \nfinalized yet, I've taken the liberty of using CURIEs rather than QNAMEs.\n\nSee http://www.w3.org/TR/curie/ for more information on the CURIE specification.\n\n== FEATURES:\n\n== 0.5.0 2008-03-19\n\n* Initial release:\n  * Should fully implement the W3C spec [http://www.w3.org/TR/curie/]\n  * Allows the creation of CURIEs\n  * Allows the parsing of a string as a putative CURIE\n  * Allows prefixes/namespaces to be added and removed\n  * Parses both safe and unsafe CURIEs but only outputs safe CURIEs\n  * Includes the FOAF namespace loaded by default\n\n== SYNOPSIS:\n\n<pre syntax=\"ruby\">require 'curies'</pre>\n<pre syntax=\"ruby\">c = Curie.new(\"foaf\", \"person\")</pre>\n\n<pre syntax=\"ruby\">c.to_s</pre>\n<pre syntax=\"ruby\">=>\"[foaf:person]\"</pre>\n\n<pre syntax=\"ruby\">Curie.parse \"[foaf:name]\"</pre>\n<pre syntax=\"ruby\">\"http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/person\"</pre>\n\n<pre syntax=\"ruby\">Curie.parse \"[foo:bar]\"</pre>\n<pre syntax=\"ruby\">\"RuntimeError: Sorry, no namespace or prefix registered for curies with the prefix foo\"</pre>\n<pre syntax=\"ruby\">Curie.add_prefixes! :foo => \"http://www.example.com/ns/foo/\"</pre>\n<pre syntax=\"ruby\">=> {\"foo\"=>\"http://www.example.com/ns/foo/\", \"foaf\"=>\"http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/\"}</pre>\n<pre syntax=\"ruby\">Curie.parse \"[foo:bar]\"</pre>\n<pre syntax=\"ruby\">=> \"http://www.example.com/ns/foo/bar\"</pre>\n\n== INSTALL:\n\nsudo gem install curies\n\n== LICENSE:\n\n(The MIT License)\n\nCopyright (c) 2009 Pius A.

Also would like to create new markup in the DOM just inside the body tag indicating to \"Please enable JavaScript to view this page properly.\"\nIf Quicktime is not installed, insert alternate markup with class hooks to style a \"Quicktime is required\" box and provide a link to Apple.com/quicktime\nBuild the controller markup by referencing a div with the class \"qtc_controller\"\nqtc_play_head should be click-drag-able to jog through the video\nThe \"track\" should be click-able to jump the video to the clicked point\nThe control button should toggle from pause to play respectively updating the class from play to pause to allow for CSS styling to alter the representative graphic of play or pause.\nAllow the user to set the width and height from the markup level. If the width and height isn't given the plugin must set it for the user (if possible).\nAllow setting the quicktime movie's background color.\n\nCompatibility\nThis plugin has been tested with jQuery 1.2.1 and newer and should work in all browsers supported by jQuery itself (it has been tested with Safari 3 and newer, Mozilla Firefox 2 and newer, Opera 9.26 and Internet Explorer 6).\nLicensing\nCopyright (c) 2008 Adam Stacoviak - http://www.adamstacoviak.com/\nLicensed under the MIT (MIT-LICENSE.txt) License.\nThis program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify\nit under the terms of the MIT-LICENSE.\nThis program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\nbut WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\nMERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

    "Readme": "== Welcome to Rails\n\nRails is a web-application and persistence framework that includes everything\nneeded to create database-backed web-applications according to the\nModel-View-Control pattern of separation. This pattern splits the view (also\ncalled the presentation) into \"dumb\" templates that are primarily responsible\nfor inserting pre-built data in between HTML tags. The model contains the\n\"smart\" domain objects (such as Account, Product, Person, Post) that holds all\nthe business logic and knows how to persist themselves to a database. The\ncontroller handles the incoming requests (such as Save New Account, Update\nProduct, Show Post) by manipulating the model and directing data to the view.\n\nIn Rails, the model is handled by what's called an object-relational mapping\nlayer entitled Active Record. This layer allows you to present the data from\ndatabase rows as objects and embellish these data objects with business logic\nmethods. You can read more about Active Record in\nlink:files/vendor/rails/activerecord/README.html.\n\nThe controller and view are handled by the Action Pack, which handles both\nlayers by its two parts: Action View and Action Controller. These two layers\nare bundled in a single package due to their heavy interdependence. This is\nunlike the relationship between the Active Record and Action Pack that is much\nmore separate. Each of these packages can be used independently outside of\nRails.  You can read more about Action Pack in\nlink:files/vendor/rails/actionpack/README.html.\n\n\n== Getting started\n\n1. At the command prompt, start a new rails application using the rails command\n   and your application name. Ex: rails myapp\n   (If you've downloaded rails in a complete tgz or zip, this step is already done)\n2. Change directory into myapp and start the web server: <tt>script/server</tt> (run with --help for options)\n3. Go to http://localhost:3000/ and get \"Welcome aboard: You\u2019re riding the Rails!\"\n4. Follow the guidelines to start developing your application\n\n\n== Web Servers\n\nBy default, Rails will try to use Mongrel and lighttpd if they are installed, otherwise\nRails will use the WEBrick, the webserver that ships with Ruby. When you run script/server,\nRails will check if Mongrel exists, then lighttpd and finally fall back to WEBrick. This ensures\nthat you can always get up and running quickly.\n\nMongrel is a Ruby-based webserver with a C-component (which requires compilation) that is\nsuitable for development and deployment of Rails applications. If you have Ruby Gems installed,\ngetting up and running with mongrel is as easy as: <tt>gem install mongrel</tt>.\nMore info at: http://mongrel.rubyforge.org\n\nIf Mongrel is not installed, Rails will look for lighttpd. It's considerably faster than\nMongrel and WEBrick and also suited for production use, but requires additional\ninstallation and currently only works well on OS X/Unix (Windows users are encouraged\nto start with Mongrel). We recommend version 1.4.11 and higher. You can download it from\nhttp://www.lighttpd.net.\n\nAnd finally, if neither Mongrel or lighttpd are installed, Rails will use the built-in Ruby\nweb server, WEBrick. WEBrick is a small Ruby web server suitable for development, but not\nfor production.\n\nBut of course its also possible to run Rails on any platform that supports FCGI.\nApache, LiteSpeed, IIS are just a few. For more information on FCGI,\nplease visit: http://wiki.rubyonrails.com/rails/pages/FastCGI\n\n\n== Debugging Rails\n\nHave \"tail -f\" commands running on the server.log and development.log. Rails will\nautomatically display debugging and runtime information to these files. Debugging\ninfo will also be shown in the browser on requests from 127.0.0.1.\n\n\n== Breakpoints\n\nBreakpoint support is available through the script/breakpointer client. This\nmeans that you can break out of execution at any point in the code, investigate\nand change the model, AND then resume execution! Example:\n\n  class WeblogController < ActionController::Base\n    def index\n      @posts = Post.find(:all)\n      breakpoint \"Breaking out from the list\"\n    end\n  end\n\nSo the controller will accept the action, run the first line, then present you\nwith a IRB prompt in the breakpointer window. Here you can do things like:\n\nExecuting breakpoint \"Breaking out from the list\" at .../webrick_server.rb:16 in 'breakpoint'\n\n  >> @posts.inspect\n  => \"[#<Post:0x14a6be8 @attributes={\\\"title\\\"=>nil, \\\"body\\\"=>nil, \\\"id\\\"=>\\\"1\\\"}>,\n       #<Post:0x14a6620 @attributes={\\\"title\\\"=>\\\"Rails you know!\\\", \\\"body\\\"=>\\\"Only ten..\\\", \\\"id\\\"=>\\\"2\\\"}>]\"\n  >> @posts.first.title = \"hello from a breakpoint\"\n  => \"hello from a breakpoint\"\n\n...and even better is that you can examine how your runtime objects actually work:\n\n  >> f = @posts.first\n  => #<Post:0x13630c4 @attributes={\"title\"=>nil, \"body\"=>nil, \"id\"=>\"1\"}>\n  >> f.\n  Display all 152 possibilities? (y or n)\n\nFinally, when you're ready to resume execution, you press CTRL-D\n\n\n== Console\n\nYou can interact with the domain model by starting the console through <tt>script/console</tt>.\nHere you'll have all parts of the application configured, just like it is when the\napplication is running. You can inspect domain models, change values, and save to the\ndatabase. Starting the script without arguments will launch it in the development environment.\nPassing an argument will specify a different environment, like <tt>script/console production</tt>.\n\nTo reload your controllers and models after launching the console run <tt>reload!</tt>\n\nTo reload your controllers and models after launching the console run <tt>reload!</tt>\n\n\n\n== Description of contents\n\napp\n  Holds all the code that's specific to this particular application.\n\napp/controllers\n  Holds controllers that should be named like weblogs_controller.rb for\n  automated URL mapping.

For more information on FCGI,\nplease visit: http://wiki.rubyonrails.com/rails/pages/FastCGI\n\n\n== Debugging Rails\n\nSometimes your application goes wrong.  Fortunately there are a lot of tools that\nwill help you debug it and get it back on the rails.\n\nFirst area to check is the application log files.  Have \"tail -f\" commands running\non the server.log and development.log. Rails will automatically display debugging\nand runtime information to these files. Debugging info will also be shown in the\nbrowser on requests from 127.0.0.1.\n\nYou can also log your own messages directly into the log file from your code using\nthe Ruby logger class from inside your controllers. Example:\n\n  class WeblogController < ActionController::Base\n    def destroy\n      @weblog = Weblog.find(params[:id])\n      @weblog.destroy\n      logger.info(\"#{Time.now} Destroyed Weblog ID ##{@weblog.id}!\")\n    end\n  end\n\nThe result will be a message in your log file along the lines of:\n\n  Mon Oct 08 14:22:29 +1000 2007 Destroyed Weblog ID #1\n\nMore information on how to use the logger is at http://www.ruby-doc.org/core/\n\nAlso, Ruby documentation can be found at http://www.ruby-lang.org/ including:\n\n* The Learning Ruby (Pickaxe) Book: http://www.ruby-doc.org/docs/ProgrammingRuby/\n* Learn to Program: http://pine.fm/LearnToProgram/  (a beginners guide)\n\nThese two online (and free) books will bring you up to speed on the Ruby language\nand also on programming in general.\n\n\n== Debugger\n\nDebugger support is available through the debugger command when you start your Mongrel or\nWebrick server with --debugger. This means that you can break out of execution at any point\nin the code, investigate and change the model, AND then resume execution! Example:\n\n  class WeblogController < ActionController::Base\n    def index\n      @posts = Post.find(:all)\n      debugger\n    end\n  end\n\nSo the controller will accept the action, run the first line, then present you\nwith a IRB prompt in the server window.

    "Readme": "How to get LovdByLess up and running\n\nUSERS WHO ARE UPGRADING READ THE UPGRADE NOTES\n\nWINDOWS USERS READ THIS: http://www.gamutworks.net/blog/?p=17\nUBUNTO USERS READ THIS: http://groups.google.com/group/lovdbyless/browse_thread/thread/d29043342c47f06?hl=en\n\nSTART BY MAKING SURE your ruby gems are version 1.2.0 or greater:\n* (sudo) gem update --system\nThen add the github repo to your gems:\n* gem sources -a http://gems.github.com\n\n\n    * Lovd runs on Ruby on Rails, so first you need to get rails running. Go download rails (http://rubyonrails.org/down) and follow it's instructions to get rails running.\n    * The directions in this README file assume some knowledge of rails, but I'll go through it a bit here first.\n    * The first thing to do is install the ruby gems that are required. For each gem listed in the README, at the command line, do something like \"gem install [gem name]\" or \"sudo gem install [gem name]\".\n    * The next thing to do is set up your database (steps 1-4 in the README). Lovd is setup to use MySQL by default, so just follow the instructions in the README and configure the files for your computer.\n    * Skip step 5.\n    * Now setup global variable (site name and url and stuff) (steps 6-13) and change the (r)html and css to suit your taste.\n    * In dev mode, search (steps 14-16) should work right out of the box (assuming you install the gems). The search instructions are really for a production environment.\n    * Start lovd with the typical \"./script/server\" and point your browser to \"http://localhost:3000\".\n\n\n\n\nInstructions:\n\nQuick Setup (currently for non-Windows users only - due to ferret gem issues):\n\n  1. Edit config/database.yml.tmp to reflect the database names you would like to use.\n  2. Edit config/environments/production.rb so asset_host reflects the name of the production asset server\n  3. cp config/database.yml.tmp config/database.yml\n  4. MAKE SURE YOU UPGRADE TO GEMS 1.3.\n  5. RUN gem sources -a http://gems.github.com\n  6. rake lovdbyless:getting_started\n  7. rake test\n  8. See step #6 below to continue setup (near \"Setup default values\")\n\nThe getting_started rake task will install all required gems, create the databases in database.yml, \nand migrate the development and test databases.\n\nManual Setup:\n\nInstall the Required Gems:\n\n1. Install these gems:\n- rflickr\n- RedCloth\n- rmagick (will require ImageMagick, which is not a gem)\n- win32console (windows only)\n(The other gems are already provided in the vendor gems dir.)\n2. Run \"rake gems:build\" to build the gems that need building\n\n\nTIPS:\nInstalling ImageMagick and RMagick\nSee these posts for tips:\nhttp://b.lesseverything.com/2007/9/26/installing-imagemagick-and-rmagick-on-mac-os-x\nhttp://www.randycullom.com/chatterbox/archives/2006/12/installing_imag.html\n\nSetup the databases:\n\n1. Edit config/database.yml.tmp to reflect the database names you would like to use.\n2. cp config/database.yml.tmp config/database.yml\n3. rake db:create:all\n4. rake mig a=no\n\nAll tests pass:\n\n5. rake\n\nSetup default values:\n\n6. Edit config/initializers/exception_notifier.rb\n7. Edit the config/environment.rb file and change the config.action_controller.session data\n8. Edit config/environments/development.rb and production.rb to suit your tastes. (Specifically config.action_mailer.delivery_method)\n9. Change the values in config/initializers/global_variables.rb to match your site and domain. (Specifically SITE_NAME, SITE, MAILER_TO_ADDRESS, MAILER_FROM_ADDRESS, REGISTRATION_RECIPIENTS)\n10. Go to the section \"About flickr integration\" and follow the steps to either use flickr or not.\n\n11. Edit public/404.html, public/500.html, app/views/account_mailer/*\n12. Edit application.css to suite your tastes.\n13. Edit app/views/home/terms.\n\nInstall Sphinx:\n\n14. Go here and get the latest sphinx: http://sphinxsearch.com/downloads.html\n15. You can follow these commands:\n  wget http://sphinxsearch.com/downloads/sphinx-0.9.8.1.tar.gz\n  tar zxvf sphinx-0.9.8.1.tar.gz\n  cd sphinx-0.9.8.1\n  ./configure\n  make\n  sudo make install\n\nConfigure Thinking Sphinx:\n\n16. rake ts:start\n17. rake ts:in\n18. Rake ts:start again in sphinx is not running.\n19. Create a cron job that will rake ts:in every hour. This will make any changes made in the last hour searchable. It should look something like this: 0 * * * * cd /var/rails/lovdbyless/current/ && rake ts:in RAILS_ENV=production\nNote: remember that to call rails vi cron you have to make sure your crontab has a PATH variable set up. Include something like this at the top of your crontab: PATH=/usr/bin:/bin:/sbin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/usr/local/bin\n\nStart Lovd By Less:\n\n20. ./script/server\n21. Go to the home page http://localhost:3000\n22. Go to the signup page and create an account.\n23. Go into the database and turn the is_admin flag to true on your new account.\n\n\n\nAbout flickr integration\n\nIf you WANT to have flickr integration in your Lovd By Less project, follow these setup instructions:\n1. Go http://flickr.com/services/api/keys/apply/ to apply for a flickr api key.\n2. Copy the Key and Secret into config/initializers/flickr.rb\n3. From the command line, run \"ruby script/authorize_flickr.rb\" and follow the instructions.\n  This stores the flickr auth stuff into config/flickr.cache. If you add this cache file to your source control, then you shouldn't have to repeat this in production. Alternatively, you can get a different key for production, if you'd like.\n\nIf you DO NOT WANT to have flickr integration in your Lovd By Less project, follow these setup instructions:\n1. Delete line 15 from app/controllers/profiles_controller.rb [@flickr = @profile.flickr_username.blank? ? [] : flickr_images(flickr.people.findByUsername(@profile.flickr_username))]\n2. Delete lines 22-35 in app/views/profiles/_public.html.erb\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIs there a google group for this project?\n\nYes. It can be found here: http://groups.google.com/group/lovdbyless\n\n\n\n\nHow to change the page a user is redirected to after login or signup:\n\nIn AccountController.rb, look for lines that contain: redirect_back_or_default home_path and change either home_path to the path you want to send them to, or change redirect_back_or_default to redirect_to, or both.\n\n\n\n\nWhy is public/javascripts/less_routes.js always modified and needing to be checked in? I swear I didn't touch it.\n\nless_routes.js is automatically generate when your app starts. Any changes to this app will be lost the next time it's generated.\n\n\n\n\nHey, I get some mysql errors when installing the mysql gem. What the funk?\n\nIf you get errors that look something like \"dlsym(0x10ef660, Init_mysql): symbol not found\" when installing your mysql gem, it may be due to an inconsistency in the build architecture of mysql, ruby, the mysql gem or all three. Reinstall the aforementioned components as necessary using the i386 build.\n\n\n",

The script (titled simply \"OSXfw\") also sets some\n        sysctls that you may want to adjust.\n\n        When done, simply run\n\n            sudo make install\n\n        and enter your password to authenticate; the files are\n        installed to the /Library/StartupItems/OSXfw directory to be\n        processed automatically at startup.\n\n        To test:\n\n            sudo /sbin/SystemStarter start OSXfw\n\n        or simply\n\n            sudo make start\n\n        You should get a few messages as the script is processed.\n        If all appears well, type\n\n            sudo ipfw list\n\n        to make sure the ruleset was loaded.\n\n        After installation, a new ruleset file can be installed thus:\n\n            sudo make install restart\n\n\nMAKEFILE TARGETS\n        install:\n            Copies the plist XML file, the OSXfw script, and\n            ipfw.conf to the StartupItems folder where it will be\n            launched at startup.\n\n        uninstall:\n            TODO\n\n        start:\n            Loads installed ruleset and sets sysctls.\n\n        stop:\n            Flushes all rules, leaving only the default allow rule.\n\n        restart:\n            Calls the 'stop' and 'start' targets sequentially.\n\n\nFILES\n        OSXfw                     SystemStarter script to load/flush rules\n        StartupParameters.plist   XML file used to configure the service\n        ipfw.conf                 Sample, user-modifiable ruleset\n\n\nSEE ALSO\n        SystemStarter(8), launchd(8), ipfw(8), sysctl(8)\n\n\nBUGS\n        The Makefile could use better error-checking.\n\n\nHISTORY\n        This product was developed to make maintenance and loading of my\n        personal firewall easier.  However, its modularity and design\n        make it suitable for others to adapt and use as they wish.\n\n\nAUTHOR\n        Tim Hammerquist <penryu@gmail.com>\n\n\n\n",

It's purpose is a testing of ActionController filters presense.\nIf you want to test presence of filters today, you have to do something like\n\n@controller.before_filters.should include(:filter_name)\n\nAs for me, it just looks ugly. No, really.\nI've spent some time thinking about it and made this filter. Sample usage could be found in spec/rails/matchers/have_filter_spec.rb\nI'll post some here:\n\n    @controller.should have_filter(:before_filter_method)\n    @controller.should have_filter(:before_filter_method).before(:any_action)\n    @controller.should have_filter(:after_some_actions_filter).after([:action_1, :action_2])\n\n== Thanks\n\nI would like to say 'thank you' to Yurii Rashkovskii (http://rashkovskii.com) and Michael Klishin (http://novemberain.com).

Currently it requires Rails 1.2.6 or above.\n\nTo use:\n\n  ./script/generate authenticated user sessions \\\n        --include-activation \\\n        --stateful\n\nThe first parameter specifies the model that gets created in signup\n(typically a user or account model).  A model with migration is \ncreated, as well as a basic controller with the create method.\n\nThe second parameter specifies the sessions controller name.  This is\nthe controller that handles the actual login/logout function on the \nsite.\n\nThe third parameter (--include-activation) generates the code for a \nActionMailer and its respective Activation Code through email.\n\nThe fourth (--stateful) builds in support for acts_as_state_machine\nand generates activation code.  This was taken from:\n\nhttp://www.vaporbase.com/postings/stateful_authentication\n\nYou can pass --skip-migration to skip the user migration.\n\nIf you're using acts_as_state_machine, define your users resource like this:\n\n    map.resources :users, :member => { :suspend   => :put,\n                                     :unsuspend => :put,\n                                     :purge     => :delete }\n\nAlso, add an observer to config/environment.rb if you chose the \n--include-activation option\n\n  config.active_record.observers = :user_observer # or whatever you \n                                                                                                    # named your model\n\nSecurity Alert\n====\n\nI introduced a change to the model controller that's been tripping \nfolks up on Rails 2.0.  The change was added as a suggestion to help\ncombat session fixation attacks.  However, this resets the Form \nAuthentication token used by Request Forgery Protection.  I've left\nit out now, since Rails 1.2.6 and Rails 2.0 will both stop session\nfixation attacks anyway.\n",

All strings in the metadata are converted to UTF-8.\n\n  The `mdh'-program can print out file metadata as YAML and package the\n  metadata with the file.\n\n  The metadata hash follows the shared file metadata spec naming, with some\n  additional fields, see list at the end of this file (Appendix A.)\n\n  For details on the MDH file format, see the end of this file (Appendix B.)\n\n\nUsage\n-----\n\n  # print out metadata for myfile.jpg\n  mdh myfile.jpg\n\n  # create myfile.jpg.mdh, which consists of an MDH metadata header + myfile.jpg\n  mdh -c myfile.jpg\n\n  # print out the metadata header from an MDH file\n  mdh -e -p myfile.jpg.mdh\n\n  # strip out the metadata header from an MDH file and write the actual file\n  # to myfile.jpg\n  mdh -e myfile.jpg.mdh\n\n  # include file path, filename, md5sum and sha1sum in the metadata header\n  mdh --path --name -m -s myfile.jpg\n\n  # guess title for document (first line that starts with a capital letter)\n  mdh --guess-title foo.ps\n\n  # guess title, abstract and metadata for document\n  mdh --guess-metadata foo.ps\n\n  # don't include document text (File.Content) in the metadata\n  mdh --no-text foo.ps\n\n  # query CiteSeer with the document title, add possible results to metadata\n  mdh --citeseer foo.ps\n\n  # query DBLP with the document title, add possible results to metadata\n  mdh --dblp foo.ps\n\n  # If you have an unknown CS document, this might help identify it:\n  mdh --guess-metadata --dblp --citeseer foo.ps\n\n  # print out the list of options\n  mdh -h\n\n  irb> require 'metadata'\n  irb> Metadata.extract('myfile.jpg')\n  irb> Metadata.extract_text('myfile.pdf')\n  irb> Pathname.new(\"myfile.jpg\").metadata\n\n\nList of supported formats\n-------------------------\n\n  Audio:\n    Whatever you manage to make mplayer play.\n    Plus special handlers for FLAC, m4a, ape, musepack, wavepack and wma.\n\n    Successfully tested with:\n      mp3, flac, ogg, wav, ra, m4a, wma\n\n    Should also work:\n      wv, mpc, ape\n\n\n  Video:\n    Whatever you manage to make mplayer play.\n\n    Successfully tested with:\n      wmv, mov, divx, xvid, flv, ogg, mpg, mkv\n\n\n  Images:\n    Should handle pretty much anything.\n    I.e. anything handled by ExifTool, ImageMagick, Imlib2 or dcraw.\n\n    Successfully tested with:\n      Web formats:\n        jpeg, png, gif, svg\n      Camera raws:\n        nef, dng, crw, pef, orf, arw, raf, cr2\n      Image editor state dumps:\n        psd, xcf\n      The rest:\n        tga, tif, bmp, xpm, ppm, pcx\n\n\n  Documents:\n    Successfully tested with:\n      Web formats:\n        html, txt\n      Print formats:\n        pdf, ps, ps.gz\n      OO formats:\n        sxi, odp\n      MS formats:\n        doc, ppt, xls\n\n    - I'm using unoconv to convert OO & MS docs to temp PDFs for the text &\n      dimensions extraction, so those bits of data are missing. MSOffice docs\n      are missing dimensions for the same reason. Here's a way to get them:\n      ( first, get Thumbnailer: http://github.com/kig/thumbnailer/tree/master )\n      $ thumbnailer -s 1 -k foo.odp /tmp/foo.jpg\n      $ mdh foo.odp\n      $ rm foo.odp-temp.pdf /tmp/foo.jpg\n\n\n  Others:\n    - BitTorrent .torrent files\n    - Archive contents: tar.gz, zip\n    - Whatever `extract' outputs and I am handling\n\n\n  Formats that yield very little metadata:\n    ai\n\n  Formats that don't yield usable metadata:\n    chm, sis, rb, rar, ttf\n\n  Formats that fail mimetype guessing:\n    exr\n\n\n\nRequirements\n------------\n\n  * Ruby 1.8\n\n  * Tons of metadata extraction programs and libs.\n    This package has many dependencies since there is no single universal\n    metadata header format that all files use. Blame resource forks, filename\n    extensions, bags of bytes and mimetypes.\n\n    List of gems:\n      flacinfo-rb\n      wmainfo-rb\n      MP4Info\n      id3lib-ruby\n      apetag\n      text\n      hpricot\n      ruby-mp3info\n\n    List of Debian packages:\n      dcraw\n      libimlib2-ruby\n      extract\n      libimage-exiftool-perl\n      poppler-utils\n      mplayer\n      html2text\n      imagemagick\n      unhtml\n      pstotext\n      antiword\n      catdoc\n      shared-mime-info\n\n  * You do want to install the latest versions of dcraw and\n    shared-mime-info to be able to handle camera raw images.\n    http://cybercom.net/~dcoffin/dcraw/\n    http://freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/shared-mime-info\n\n  * Python + chardet library\n    http://chardet.feedparser.org/\n\n\nInstall\n-------\n\n  De-compress archive and enter its top directory.\n  Then type:\n\n   ($ su)\n    # ruby setup.rb\n\n  These simple step installs this program under the default\n  location of Ruby libraries.

I wrote this mostly to get an idea how such things can be implemented, and have not used it since.\nFor any serious Common Lisp STM needs the cl-stm system is probably much better. That said, since I dropped it on GitHub I might just as well document it. I suppose there is a possibility that it might be informational to someone.\nBasic ideas\nThis system is much simpler than aforementioned cl-stm because it puts more responsibility on the user. While cl-stm uses the code walker to capture side effects into transactions, this system assumes all information is shared through special references to immutable data, called tvars following Haskell example. Of course, unlike in Haskell it is not possible to enforce neither the immutability of referenced data or that tvars will be accessed though transaction logs.\nImmutable datastructures are available though, for example, FSet library.\nTransactions as implemented here are in principle composable.\nDependencies\n\nSBCL\n\nsb-thread is used directly. bordeaux-threads does not have non-waiting with-mutex.\n\nIterate\nAlexandria\n\nTests (what few there are) require also:\n\nstefil\nfset\n\nReference\nNote that transaction failure is communicated using signals. Creating a t condition handler will break them.\nFunction make-tvar &optional value\nCreate a transactional variable with an optional initial value.\nFunction get-tvar tvar &optional transaction-log wrapping-logs\nFunction tvar-ref tvar\nMostly synonymous. Optional arguments of the first form are used internally and default to thread-local special bindings. Access contents of a transactional variable. Can be used outside of transaction.\nFunction put-tvar tvar new-value &optional transaction-log wrapping-logs\nFunction (setf tvar-ref) new-value tvar\nMostly synonymous. Optional arguments of the first form are used internally and default to thread-local special bindings. Sets contents of a transactional variable. Can be used outside of transaction.\nFunction retry-transaction\nRestart transaction. Will suspend the thread until one of the tvars which were accessed so far in the transaction is changed.\nFunction with-retry-transaction &body body\nExecute body within transaction. It will be retried if any tvars which were read during it have been changed.\nFunction with-orelse-transaction &body (alternative-body)*\nExecute bodies withing orelse transaction, ie. if the first fails, the second is immediately attempted and so on. If all fail and there was at least one explicit (retry-transaction) the thread will be suspended until some referenced tvar changes.\n",

    "Name": "thumbnailer",
    "Readme": "Description\n-----------\n\n  This package `Thumbnailer' comes with a library called `thumbnailer' and\n  a program called `thumbnailer'.\n\n  The thumbnailer library uses external thumbnailing programs to create an\n  image of wanted size from a given file. Supported output formats are PNG\n  and JPEG.\n\n  As my own use for the thumbnailer is as a source of mipmapped textures,\n  the default behaviour is to create a full-size thumbnail. E.g. if you\n  have a 3039x2014 camera raw, you'll get a 3039x2014 jpeg or png out. For\n  PDFs and videos, the default size is 2048px on the longest side.\n\n\nUsage\n-----\n\n  # create a full-size jpeg thumbnail\n  $ thumbnailer foo.png foo.jpg\n  $ thumbnailer bar.avi foo.jpg\n\n  # create a png thumbnail that's scaled to fit in a 1024x1024 square\n  $ thumbnailer -s 1024 foo.pdf foo_thumb.png\n\n\n  irb> require 'thumbnailer'\n\n  # fit the jpg inside a 256x256 square\n  irb> Thumbnailer.thumbnail(\"foo.png\", \"foo_thumb.jpg\", 256)\n\n  # page five of the pdf\n  irb> Thumbnailer.thumbnail(\"bar.pdf\", \"bar_thumb.png\", 2048, 5)\n\n  # take the main thumbnail at 30 seconds into the video\n  irb> Thumbnailer.thumbnail(\"qux.avi\", \"qux_thumb.jpg\", 1024, 30)\n\n\nList of supported formats\n-------------------------\n\n  Images\n    Most image formats. PSDs probably not too accurately.\n\n    Successfully tested:\n      jpg, png, gif, svg,\n      orf, nef, dng, crw, arw, raf, pef, cr2,\n      tif, xpm, ppm, tga, pcx, bmp,\n      psd\n\n    Uses image icon:\n      xcf\n\n    Uses default icon:\n      ai, exr\n\n\n  Videos\n    Anything mplayer / ffmpeg can play.\n\n    Successfully tested:\n      mkv, flv, avi, mpg, mov, wmv, ogg\n\n\n  Audio\n    Anything mplayer can play.\n\n    The audio thumbnailing system is a wee bit peculiar. It relies\n    on a Tcl/Tk app to create a waveform and spectrogram of the audio.\n\n    Successfully tested:\n      mp3, wav, m4a, flac, ra, ogg, wma\n\n    Uses audio icon:\n      ape\n\n\n  Documents\n    The document thumbnailer first converts the document into a PDF, then\n    thumbnails the PDF. The PDF conversion requires ooffice for office\n    documents.\n\n    The HTML thumbnailer uses GtkMozEmbed.\n\n    Successfully tested:\n      pdf, html, ps, ps.gz, txt, sxi, odp, ppt, doc, xls\n\n    Uses default icon:\n      chm\n\n\n  Others\n    Thumbnailer uses a mimetype-specific icon from its icons-directory.\n    If there's an SVG icon, the SVG icon will be used. Otherwise a PNG icon\n    will be used.\n\n    Successfully tested:\n      directory, bz2, rar, tar.gz, ttf\n\n    Uses default icon:\n      sis, torrent, rb\n\n\nRequirements\n------------\n\n  * Ruby 1.8\n\n  * Metadata library for Ruby\n    http://github.com/kig/metadata/tree/master\n\n  * Tons of image converter programs and shared-mime-info.\n    http://freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/shared-mime-info\n    List of debian packages:\n      inkscape\n      xvfb\n      openoffice.org\n      python-uno\n      libimlib2-ruby\n      netpbm\n      paps\n      gs-common\n      imagemagick\n      mplayer\n      ffmpeg\n      libsnack2\n      poppler-utils (v0.6 or later, http://poppler.freedesktop.org/)\n\n  * You need the latest version of dcraw to handle some camera raw images.\n    http://cybercom.net/~dcoffin/dcraw/\n\n  * You need unoconv for thumbnailing office documents:\n    http://dag.wieers.com/home-made/unoconv/\n\n\nInstall\n-------\n\n  De-compress archive and enter its top directory.\n  Then type:\n\n   ($ su)\n    # ruby setup.rb\n\n  These simple step installs this program under the default\n  location of Ruby libraries.

    "Readme": "= make_resourceful\n===== Take back control of your Controllers. Make them awesome. Make them sleek. Make them resourceful.\n\nREST is a fine pattern for designing controllers,\nbut it can be pretty repetitive.\nWho wants to write out the same actions and copy the same model lookup logic\nall over their application?\n\nmake_resourceful handles all that for you.\nIt sets up all your RESTful actions and responses with next to no code.\nEverything has full, sensible default functionality.\n\nOf course, no controller _only_ uses the defaults.\nSo make_resourceful can be massively customized,\nwhile still keeping your controllers trim and readable.\n\n== Get it!\n\nRails\n\n  $ ruby script/plugin install http://svn.hamptoncatlin.com/make_resourceful/trunk\n  $ mv vendor/plugins/trunk vendor/plugins/make_resourceful\n\nSubversion\n\n  $ svn co http://svn.hamptoncatlin.com/make_resourceful/trunk make_resourceful\n\n== Use it!\n\nThe easiest way to start with make_resourceful\nis to run the resource_scaffold generator.\nIt uses the same syntax as the Rails scaffold_resource generator:\n\n  $ script/generate resource_scaffold post title:string body:text\n\nIt does, however, require Haml[http://haml.hamptoncatlin.com].\nYou _are_ using Haml, right? No?\nI'll wait here while you go fall in love with it.\n\nIf you want to try make_resourceful on one of your current controllers,\njust replace the mess of repetition with this:\n\n  class FooController < ApplicationController\n    make_resourceful do\n      actions :all\n    end\n  end\n\nThose three lines will replace the entire default controller\nthat comes out of the scaffold_resource generator.\n\n=== Really?\n\nYes.\n\n=== Can I do nested resources?\n\n  make_resourceful do\n    actions :all\n    belongs_to :post\n  end\n\n=== What if I want to use fancy permalinks?\n\n  def current_object\n    @current_object ||= current_model.find_by_permalink(params[:id])\n  end\n\n=== What about paging?\n\n  def current_objects\n    @current_object ||= current_model.find(:all,\n      :order => \"created_at DESC\", :page => {:current => params[:page], :size => 10 } )\n  end\n\n=== What if I want to do something in the middle of an action?\n\n  before :show, :index do\n    @page_title = \"Awesome!\"\n  end\n\n  after :create_fails do\n    @page_title = \"Not So Awesome!\"\n  end\n\n=== What about all of my awesome respond_to blocks for my XML APIs and RJS responses?\n\n  response_for :show do |format|\n    format.html\n    format.js\n    format.xml\n  end\n\n  response_for :update_fails do |format|\n    format.html { render :action => 'edit' }\n    format.json { render :json => false.to_json, :status => 422 }\n  end\n\n=== So I guess I have to write responses for all my actions?\n\nNope! make_resourceful makes them do the right thing by default.\nYou only need to customize them if you want to do something special.\n\n=== Seriously?!\n\nYes!\n\n== Grok it!\n\n=== +make_resourceful+ the Method\n\nThe +make_resourceful+ block is where most of the action happens.\nHere you specify which actions you want to auto-generate,\nwhat code you want to run for given callbacks,\nand so forth.\n\nYou also use the block to declare various bits of information about your controller.\nFor instance, if the controller is nested, you'd call +belongs_to+.\nIf you wanted to expose your models as some sort of text format,\nyou'd call +publish+.\n\nCheck out the documentation of Resourceful::Builder\nfor more information on the methods you can call here.\n\n=== Helper Methods\n\nmake_resourceful provides lots of useful methods\nthat can be used in your callbacks and in your views.\nThey range from accessing the records you're looking up\nto easily generating URLs for a record\nto getting information about the action itself.\n\nTwo of the most useful methods are +current_object+ and +current_objects+\n(note the subtle plurality difference).\n+current_objects+ only works for +index+,\nand returns all the records in the current model.\n+current_object+ works for all actions other than +index+,\nand returns the record that's currently being dealt with.\n\nThe full documentation of the helper methods\nis in Resourceful::Default::Accessors and Resourceful::Default::URLs.\n\n=== Nested Resources\n\nmake_resourceful supports easy management of nested resources.\nThis is set up with the Resourceful::Builder#belongs_to declaration.\nPass in the name of the parent model,\n\n  belongs_to :user\n\nand everything will be taken care of.\nWhen +index+ is run for GET /users/12/albums,\nparent_object[link:classes/Resourceful/Accessors.html#M000024]\nwill get <tt>User.find(params[:user_id])</tt>,\nand current_objects[link:classes/Resourceful/Default/Accessors.html#M000010]\nwill get <tt>parent_object.albums</tt>.\nWhen +create+ is run for POST /users/12/albums,\nthe newly created Album will automatically belong to the user\nwith id 12.\n\nThe normal non-scoped actions still work, too.\nGET /albums/15 runs just fine.\nmake_resourceful knows that since there's no <tt>params[:user_id]</tt>,\nyou just want to deal with the album.\n\nYou can even have a single resource nested under several different resources.\nJust pass multiple parent names to the Resourceful::Builder#belongs_to, like\n\n  belongs_to :user, :artist\n\nThen /users/15/albums and /artists/7/albums will both work.\n\nThis does, however, mean that make_resourceful only supports one level of nesting.\nThere's no automatic handling of /users/15/collections/437/albums.\nHowever, this is really the best way to organize most resources anyway;\nsee this article[http://weblog.jamisbuck.org/2007/2/5/nesting-resources].\n\nIf you really need a deeply nested controller,\nit should be easy enough to set up on your own.\nJust override current_model[link:classes/Resourceful/Default/Accessors.html#M000018].\nSee the next section for more details.\n\n=== Overriding Methods\n\nNot only are helper methods useful to the developer to use,\nthey're used internally by the actions created by make_resourceful.\nThus one of the main ways make_resourceful can be customized\nis by overriding accessors.\n\nFor instance, if you want to only look up the 10 most recent records for +index+,\nyou're override +current_objects+.\nIf you wanted to use a different model than that suggested by the name of the controller,\nyou'd override +current_model+.\n\nWhen you're overriding methods that do SQL lookups, though, be a little cautious.\nBy default, these methods cache their values in instance variables\nso that multiple SQL queries aren't run on multiple calls.\nWhen overriding them, it's wise for you to do the same.\nFor instance,\n\n  def current_object\n    @current_object ||= current_model.find_by_name(params[:name])\n  end\n\n=== For More Information...\n\nHaven't found all the information you need in the RDoc?\nStill a little confused about something?\nDon't despair, there are still more resources available!\n\n*

The body can contain any lisp code, as well as forms that\nbegin with =>.\nA specification is run to produce a list of results: which examples\npassed, and which failed (and with what condition, although for now\nthe condition text is not very useful).\nSee the Lisp files in the examples directory for some very simple\nexamples of specifications.\nLoading\n(asdf:oos 'asdf:load-op :cl-spec)\n\nUsage\nThere are three ways to run a spec.\nFirst, by evaluating it (from the command line, or in an editor\nwindow).  This runs the specification, and returns a short string\ncounting the number of tests that succeeded, or listing the names of\nthe tests that failed.  The intent is that this will be useful to look\nat in your minibuffer or on your console.\nSecond, by applying RUN-SPECIFICATION to a path name (STRING or\nPATHNAME):\n    (run-specification \"examples/failing-spec.lisp\")\nThis prints a text summary of the pass/fail status to standard output,\nlike so:\n.FF..\n\n1)\n\"should fail\" FAILED\nCondition EXPECTATION-NOT-MET was signalled.\n/users/osteele/documents/projects/cl-spec/examples/failing-spec.lisp\n\n2)\n\"should also fail\" FAILED\nCondition EXPECTATION-NOT-MET was signalled.\n/users/osteele/documents/projects/cl-spec/examples/failing-spec.lisp\n\nFinished in 0.0050000004 seconds\n\n5 examples, 2 failures\n\nFinally, the :FORMAT keyword can be used to create an HTML file instead:\n(run-specification \"examples/plus-spec.lisp\" :format 'html)\n\nThe HTML files in the examples directory were thus produced.\nLicense\nThis package is Copyright 2007 by Oliver Steele.

    "Readme": "ActsAsTaggableOn\n\n\n\n\n\nThis plugin was originally based on Acts as Taggable on Steroids by Jonathan Viney.\nIt has evolved substantially since that point, but all credit goes to him for the\ninitial tagging functionality that so many people have used.\nFor instance, in a social network, a user might have tags that are called skills,\ninterests, sports, and more. There is no real way to differentiate between tags and\nso an implementation of this type is not possible with acts as taggable on steroids.\nEnter Acts as Taggable On. Rather than tying functionality to a specific keyword\n(namely tags), acts as taggable on allows you to specify an arbitrary number of\ntag \"contexts\" that can be used locally or in combination in the same way steroids\nwas used.\nInstallation\nTo use it, add it to your Gemfile:\ngem 'acts-as-taggable-on', '~> 4.0'\nand bundle:\nbundle\nPost Installation\nInstall migrations\n# For the latest versions :\nrake acts_as_taggable_on_engine:install:migrations\nReview the generated migrations then migrate :\nrake db:migrate\nFor MySql users\nYou can circumvent at any time the problem of special characters issue 623 by setting in an initializer file:\nActsAsTaggableOn.force_binary_collation = true\nOr by running this rake task:\nrake acts_as_taggable_on_engine:tag_names:collate_bin\nSee the Configuration section for more details, and a general note valid for older\nversion of the gem.\nUsage\nSetup\nclass User < ActiveRecord::Base\n  acts_as_taggable # Alias for acts_as_taggable_on :tags\n  acts_as_taggable_on :skills, :interests\nend\n\nclass UsersController < ApplicationController\n  def user_params\n    params.require(:user).permit(:name, :tag_list) ## Rails 4 strong params usage\n  end\nend\n\n@user = User.new(:name => \"Bobby\")\nAdd and remove a single tag\n@user.tag_list.add(\"awesome\")   # add a single tag. alias for <<\n@user.tag_list.remove(\"awesome\") # remove a single tag\nAdd and remove multiple tags in an array\n@user.tag_list.add(\"awesome\", \"slick\")\n@user.tag_list.remove(\"awesome\", \"slick\")\nYou can also add and remove tags in format of String. This would\nbe convenient in some cases such as handling tag input param in a String.\nPay attention you need to add parse: true as option in this case.\nYou may also want to take a look at delimiter in the string. The default\nis comma , so you don't need to do anything here. However, if you made\na change on delimiter setting, make sure the string will match. See\nconfiguration for more about delimiter.\n@user.tag_list.add(\"awesome, slick\", parse: true)\n@user.tag_list.remove(\"awesome, slick\", parse: true)\nYou can also add and remove tags by direct assignment. Note this will\nremove existing tags so use it with attention.\n@user.tag_list = \"awesome, slick, hefty\"\n@user.save\n@user.reload\n@user.tags\n=> [#<ActsAsTaggableOn::Tag id: 1, name: \"awesome\", taggings_count: 1>,\n #<ActsAsTaggableOn::Tag id: 2, name: \"slick\", taggings_count: 1>,\n #<ActsAsTaggableOn::Tag id: 3, name: \"hefty\", taggings_count: 1>]\nWith the defined context in model, you have multiple new methods at disposal\nto manage and view the tags in the context. For example, with :skill context\nthese methods are added to the model: skill_list(and skill_list.add, skill_list.remove\nskill_list=), skills(plural), skill_counts.\n@user.skill_list = \"joking, clowning, boxing\"\n@user.save\n@user.reload\n@user.skills\n=> [#<ActsAsTaggableOn::Tag id: 1, name: \"joking\", taggings_count: 1>,\n #<ActsAsTaggableOn::Tag id: 2, name: \"clowning\", taggings_count: 1>,\n #<ActsAsTaggableOn::Tag id: 3, name: \"boxing\", taggings_count: 1>]\n\n@user.skill_list.add(\"coding\")\n\n@user.skill_list\n# => [\"joking\", \"clowning\", \"boxing\", \"coding\"]\n\n@another_user = User.new(:name => \"Alice\")\n@another_user.skill_list.add(\"clowning\")\n@another_user.save\n\nUser.skill_counts\n=> [#<ActsAsTaggableOn::Tag id: 1, name: \"joking\", taggings_count: 1>,\n #<ActsAsTaggableOn::Tag id: 2, name: \"clowning\", taggings_count: 2>,\n #<ActsAsTaggableOn::Tag id: 3, name: \"boxing\", taggings_count: 1>]\nTo preserve the order in which tags are created use acts_as_ordered_taggable:\nclass User < ActiveRecord::Base\n  # Alias for acts_as_ordered_taggable_on :tags\n  acts_as_ordered_taggable\n  acts_as_ordered_taggable_on :skills, :interests\nend\n\n@user = User.new(:name => \"Bobby\")\n@user.tag_list = \"east, south\"\n@user.save\n\n@user.tag_list = \"north, east, south, west\"\n@user.save\n\n@user.reload\n@user.tag_list # => [\"north\", \"east\", \"south\", \"west\"]\nFinding most or least used tags\nYou can find the most or least used tags by using:\nActsAsTaggableOn::Tag.most_used\nActsAsTaggableOn::Tag.least_used\nYou can also filter the results by passing the method a limit, however the default limit is 20.\nActsAsTaggableOn::Tag.most_used(10)\nActsAsTaggableOn::Tag.least_used(10)\nFinding Tagged Objects\nActs As Taggable On uses scopes to create an association for tags.\nThis way you can mix and match to filter down your results.\nclass User < ActiveRecord::Base\n  acts_as_taggable_on :tags, :skills\n  scope :by_join_date, order(\"created_at DESC\")\nend\n\nUser.tagged_with(\"awesome\").by_join_date\nUser.tagged_with(\"awesome\").by_join_date.paginate(:page => params[:page], :per_page => 20)\n\n# Find users that matches all given tags:\nUser.tagged_with([\"awesome\", \"cool\"], :match_all => true)\n\n# Find users with any of the specified tags:\nUser.tagged_with([\"awesome\", \"cool\"], :any => true)\n\n# Find users that has not been tagged with awesome or cool:\nUser.tagged_with([\"awesome\", \"cool\"], :exclude => true)\n\n# Find users with any of the tags based on context:\nUser.tagged_with(['awesome', 'cool'], :on => :tags, :any => true).tagged_with(['smart', 'shy'], :on => :skills, :any => true)\nYou can also use :wild => true option along with :any or :exclude option. It will be looking for %awesome% and %cool% in SQL.\nTip: User.tagged_with([]) or User.tagged_with('') will return [], an empty set of records.\nRelationships\nYou can find objects of the same type based on similar tags on certain contexts.\nAlso, objects will be returned in descending order based on the total number of\nmatched tags.\n@bobby = User.find_by_name(\"Bobby\")\n@bobby.skill_list # => [\"jogging\", \"diving\"]\n\n@frankie = User.find_by_name(\"Frankie\")\n@frankie.skill_list # => [\"hacking\"]\n\n@tom = User.find_by_name(\"Tom\")\n@tom.skill_list # => [\"hacking\", \"jogging\", \"diving\"]\n\n@tom.find_related_skills # => [<User name=\"Bobby\">, <User name=\"Frankie\">]\n@bobby.find_related_skills # => [<User name=\"Tom\">]\n@frankie.find_related_skills # => [<User name=\"Tom\">]\nDynamic Tag Contexts\nIn addition to the generated tag contexts in the definition, it is also possible\nto allow for dynamic tag contexts (this could be user generated tag contexts!)\n@user = User.new(:name => \"Bobby\")\n@user.set_tag_list_on(:customs, \"same, as, tag, list\")\n@user.tag_list_on(:customs) # => [\"same\", \"as\", \"tag\", \"list\"]\n@user.save\n@user.tags_on(:customs) # => [<Tag name='same'>,...]\n@user.tag_counts_on(:customs)\nUser.tagged_with(\"same\", :on => :customs) # => [@user]\nTag Parsers\nIf you want to change how tags are parsed, you can define your own implementation:\nclass MyParser < ActsAsTaggableOn::GenericParser\n  def parse\n    ActsAsTaggableOn::TagList.new.tap do |tag_list|\n      tag_list.add @tag_list.split('|')\n    end\n  end\nend\nNow you can use this parser, passing it as parameter:\n@user = User.new(:name => \"Bobby\")\n@user.tag_list = \"east, south\"\n@user.tag_list.add(\"north|west\", parser: MyParser)\n@user.tag_list # => [\"north\", \"east\", \"south\", \"west\"]\n\n# Or also:\n@user.tag_list.parser = MyParser\n@user.tag_list.add(\"north|west\")\n@user.tag_list # => [\"north\", \"east\", \"south\", \"west\"]\nOr change it globally:\nActsAsTaggableOn.default_parser = MyParser\n@user = User.new(:name => \"Bobby\")\n@user.tag_list = \"east|south\"\n@user.tag_list # => [\"east\", \"south\"]\nTag Ownership\nTags can have owners:\nclass User < ActiveRecord::Base\n  acts_as_tagger\nend\n\nclass Photo < ActiveRecord::Base\n  acts_as_taggable_on :locations\nend\n\n@some_user.tag(@some_photo, :with => \"paris, normandy\", :on => :locations)\n@some_user.owned_taggings\n@some_user.owned_tags\nPhoto.tagged_with(\"paris\", :on => :locations, :owned_by => @some_user)\n@some_photo.locations_from(@some_user) # => [\"paris\", \"normandy\"]\n@some_photo.owner_tags_on(@some_user, :locations) # => [#<ActsAsTaggableOn::Tag id: 1, name: \"paris\">...]\n@some_photo.owner_tags_on(nil, :locations) # => Ownerships equivalent to saying @some_photo.locations\n@some_user.tag(@some_photo, :with => \"paris, normandy\", :on => :locations, :skip_save => true) #won't save @some_photo object\nWorking with Owned Tags\nNote that tag_list only returns tags whose taggings do not have an owner. Continuing from the above example:\n@some_photo.tag_list # => []\nTo retrieve all tags of an object (regardless of ownership) or if only one owner can tag the object, use all_tags_list.\nAdding owned tags\nNote that owned tags are added all at once, in the form of comma seperated tags in string.\nAlso, when you try to add owned tags again, it simply overwrites the previous set of owned tags.\nSo to append tags in previously existing owned tags list, go as follows:\ndef add_owned_tag \n    @some_item = Item.find(params[:id])\n    owned_tag_list = @some_item.all_tag_list - @some_item.tag_list\n    owned_tag_list += [(params[:tag])]\n    @tag_owner.tag(@some_item, :with => stringify(owned_tag_list), :on => :tags)\n    @some_item.save   \nend\n\ndef stringify(tag_list)\n    tag_list.inject('') { |memo, tag| memo += (tag + ',') }[0..-1]\nend\nRemoving owned tags\nSimilarly as above, removing will be as follows:\ndef remove_owned_tag \n    @some_item = Item.find(params[:id])\n    owned_tag_list = @some_item.all_tag_list - @some_item.tag_list\n    owned_tag_list -= [(params[:tag])]\n    @tag_owner.tag(@some_item, :with => stringify(owned_tag_list), :on => :tags)\n    @some_item.save   \nend\nDirty objects\n@bobby = User.find_by_name(\"Bobby\")\n@bobby.skill_list # => [\"jogging\", \"diving\"]\n\n@bobby.skill_list_changed? #=> false\n@bobby.changes #=> {}\n\n@bobby.skill_list = \"swimming\"\n@bobby.changes.should == {\"skill_list\"=>[\"jogging, diving\", [\"swimming\"]]}\n@bobby.skill_list_changed? #=> true\n\n@bobby.skill_list_change.should == [\"jogging, diving\", [\"swimming\"]]\nTag cloud calculations\nTo construct tag clouds, the frequency of each tag needs to be calculated.\nBecause we specified acts_as_taggable_on on the User class, we can\nget a calculation of all the tag counts by using User.tag_counts_on(:customs). But what if we wanted a tag count for\na single user's posts? To achieve this we call tag_counts on the association:\nUser.find(:first).posts.tag_counts_on(:tags)\nA helper is included to assist with generating tag clouds.\nHere is an example that generates a tag cloud.\nHelper:\nmodule PostsHelper\n  include ActsAsTaggableOn::TagsHelper\nend\nController:\nclass PostController < ApplicationController\n  def tag_cloud\n    @tags = Post.tag_counts_on(:tags)\n  end\nend\nView:\n<% tag_cloud(@tags, %w(css1 css2 css3 css4)) do |tag, css_class| %>\n  <%= link_to tag.name, { :action => :tag, :id => tag.name }, :class => css_class %>\n<% end %>\nCSS:\n.css1 { font-size: 1.0em; }\n.css2 { font-size: 1.2em; }\n.css3 { font-size: 1.4em; }\n.css4 { font-size: 1.6em; }\nConfiguration\nIf you would like to remove unused tag objects after removing taggings, add:\nActsAsTaggableOn.remove_unused_tags = true\nIf you want force tags to be saved downcased:\nActsAsTaggableOn.force_lowercase = true\nIf you want tags to be saved parametrized (you can redefine to_param as well):\nActsAsTaggableOn.force_parameterize = true\nIf you would like tags to be case-sensitive and not use LIKE queries for creation:\nActsAsTaggableOn.strict_case_match = true\nIf you would like to have an exact match covering special characters with MySql:\nActsAsTaggableOn.force_binary_collation = true\nIf you want to change the default delimiter (it defaults to ','). You can also pass in an array of delimiters such as ([',', '|']):\nActsAsTaggableOn.delimiter = ','\nNOTE 1: SQLite by default can't upcase or downcase multibyte characters, resulting in unwanted behavior. Load the SQLite ICU extension for proper handle of such characters. See docs\nNOTE 2: the option force_binary_collation is strongest than strict_case_match and when\nset to true, the strict_case_match is ignored.\nTo roughly apply the force_binary_collation behaviour with a version of the gem <= 3.4.4, execute the following commands in the MySql console:\nUSE my_wonderful_app_db;\nALTER TABLE tags MODIFY name VARCHAR(255) CHARACTER SET utf8 COLLATE utf8_bin;\nUpgrading\nsee UPGRADING\nContributors\nWe have a long list of valued contributors. Check them all\nCompatibility\nVersions 2.x are compatible with Ruby 1.8.7+ and Rails 3.\nVersions 2.4.1 and up are compatible with Rails 4 too (thanks to arabonradar and cwoodcox).\nVersions >= 3.x are compatible with Ruby 1.9.3+ and Rails 3 and 4.\nVersions >= 4.x are compatible with Ruby 2.0.0+ and Rails 4 and 5.\nFor an up-to-date roadmap, see https://github.com/mbleigh/acts-as-taggable-on/milestones\nTODO\n\nWrite benchmark script\nResolve concurrency issues\n\nTesting\nActs As Taggable On uses RSpec for its test coverage.

    "Readme": "\n:include:QUICKLINKS\n\n= Why DataMapper?\n\n== Open Development\n\nDataMapper sports a very accessible code-base and a welcoming community.\nOutside contributions and feedback are welcome and encouraged, especially\nconstructive criticism. Make your voice heard! Submit a\nticket[http://wm.lighthouseapp.com/projects/4819-datamapper/overview] or\npatch[http://wm.lighthouseapp.com/projects/4819-datamapper/overview], speak up\non our mailing-list[http://groups.google.com/group/datamapper/], chat with us\non irc[irc://irc.freenode.net/#datamapper], write a spec, get it reviewed, ask\nfor commit rights. It's as easy as that to become a contributor.\n\n== Identity Map\n\nOne row in the database should equal one object reference. Pretty simple idea.\nPretty profound impact. If you run the following code in ActiveRecord you'll\nsee all <tt>false</tt> results. Do the same in DataMapper and it's\n<tt>true</tt> all the way down.\n\n  @parent = Tree.find(:first, :conditions => ['name = ?', 'bob'])\n\n  @parent.children.each do |child|\n    puts @parent.object_id == child.parent.object_id\n  end\n\nThis makes DataMapper faster and allocate less resources to get things done.\n\n== Don't Do What You Don't Have To\n\nActiveRecord updates every column in a row during a save whether that column\nchanged or not. So it performs work it doesn't really need to making it much\nslower, and more likely to eat data during concurrent access if you don't go\naround adding locking support to everything.\n\nDataMapper only does what it needs to. So it plays well with others. You can\nuse it in an Integration Database without worrying that your application will\nbe a bad actor causing trouble for all of your other processes.\n\n== Eager Loading\n\nReady for something amazing? The following example executes only two queries.\n\n  zoos = Zoo.all\n  first = zoos.first\n  first.exhibits  # Loads the exhibits for all the Zoo objects in the zoos variable.\n\nPretty impressive huh? The idea is that you aren't going to load a set of\nobjects and use only an association in just one of them. This should hold up\npretty well against a 99% rule. When you don't want it to work like this, just\nload the item you want in it's own set. So the DataMapper thinks ahead. We\nlike to call it \"performant by default\". This feature single-handedly wipes\nout the \"N+1 Query Problem\". No need to specify an <tt>include</tt> option in\nyour finders.\n\n== Laziness Can Be A Virtue\n\nText columns are expensive in databases. They're generally stored in a\ndifferent place than the rest of your data. So instead of a fast sequential\nread from your hard-drive, your database server has to hop around all over the\nplace to get what it needs. Since ActiveRecord returns everything by default,\nadding a text column to a table slows everything down drastically, across the\nboard.\n\nNot so with the DataMapper. Text fields are treated like in-row associations\nby default, meaning they only load when you need them. If you want more\ncontrol you can enable or disable this feature for any column (not just\ntext-fields) by passing a @lazy@ option to your column mapping with a value of\n<tt>true</tt> or <tt>false</tt>.\n\n  class Animal\n    include DataMapper::Resource\n    property :name, String\n    property :notes, DataMapper::Types::Text, :lazy => false\n  end\n\nPlus, lazy-loading of text fields happens automatically and intelligently when\nworking with associations.  The following only issues 2 queries to load up all\nof the notes fields on each animal:\n\n  animals = Animal.all\n  animals.each do |pet|\n    pet.notes\n  end\n\n== Plays Well With Others\n\nIn ActiveRecord, all your columns are mapped, whether you want them or not.\nThis slows things down. In the DataMapper you define your mappings in your\nmodel. So instead of an _ALTER TABLE ADD COLUMN_ in your Database, you simply\nadd a <tt>property :name, :string</tt> to your model. DRY. No schema.rb. No\nmigration files to conflict or die without reverting changes. Your model\ndrives the database, not the other way around.\n\nUnless of course you want to map to a legacy database. Raise your hand if you\nlike seeing a method called <tt>col2Name</tt> on your model just because\nthat's what it's called in an old database you can't afford to change right\nnow? In DataMapper you control the mappings:\n\n  class Fruit\n    include DataMapper::Resource\n    set_table_name 'frt'\n    property :name, String, :column => 'col2Name'\n  end\n\n== All Ruby, All The Time\n\nIt's great that ActiveRecord allows you to write SQL when you need to, but\nshould we have to so often?\n\nDataMapper supports issuing your own SQL, but it also provides more helpers\nand a unique hash-based condition syntax to cover more of the use-cases where\nissuing your own SQL would have been the only way to go. For example, any\nfinder option that's non-standard is considered a condition. So you can write\n<tt>Zoo.all(:name => 'Dallas')</tt> and DataMapper will look for zoos with the\nname of 'Dallas'.\n\nIt's just a little thing, but it's so much nicer than writing\n<tt>Zoo.find(:all, :conditions => ['name = ?', 'Dallas'])</tt>. What if you\nneed other comparisons though? Try these:\n\n  Zoo.first(:name => 'Galveston')\n\n  # 'gt' means greater-than. We also do 'lt'.\n  Person.all(:age.gt => 30)\n\n  # 'gte' means greather-than-or-equal-to. We also do 'lte'.\n  Person.all(:age.gte => 30)\n\n  Person.all(:name.not => 'bob')\n\n  # If the value of a pair is an Array, we do an IN-clause for you.\n  Person.all(:name.like => 'S%', :id => [1, 2, 3, 4, 5])\n\n  # An alias for Zoo.find(11)\n  Zoo[11]\n\n  # Does a NOT IN () clause for you.\n  Person.all(:name.not => ['bob','rick','steve'])\n\nSee? Fewer SQL fragments dirtying your Ruby code. And that's just a few of the\nnice syntax tweaks DataMapper delivers out of the box...\n\n== Better Is Great, But Familiar Is Nice\n\nThe DataMapper also supports a lot of old-fashioned ActiveRecord syntax. We\nwant to make it easy for you to get started, so aside from mapping your\ncolumns and changing the base-class your models inherit from, much of AR\nsyntax for finders are supported as well, making your transition easy.\n\n",

Thrift provides clean\nabstractions for data transport, data serialization, and application\nlevel processing. The code generation system takes a simple definition\nlanguage as its input and generates code across programming languages that\nuses the abstracted stack to build interoperable RPC clients and servers.\n\nThrift is specifically designed to support non-atomic version changes\nacross client and server code.\n\nFor more details on Thrift's design and implementation, take a gander at\nthe Thrift whitepaper included in this distribution or at the README files\nin your particular subdirectory of interest.\n\nHeirarchy\n=========\n\nthrift/\n\n  compiler/\n    Contains the Thrift compiler, implemented in C++.\n\n  lib/\n    Contains the Thrift software library implementation, subdivided by\n    language of implementation.\n\n    cpp/\n    java/\n    php/\n    py/\n    rb/\n\n  test/\n\n    Contains sample Thrift files and test code across the target programming\n    languages.\n\n  tutorial/\n\n    Contains a basic tutorial that will teach you how to develop software\n    using Thrift.\n\nRequirements\n============\n\nThrift requires boost shared pointers from boost-1.33.1 or greater, see:\nhttp://www.boost.org/libs/smart_ptr/smart_ptr.htm\n\nSome portions of Thrift also depend upon libevent, see:\nhttp://monkey.org/~provos/libevent/\n\nSome portions of Thrift also depend upon zlib, see:\nhttp://www.zlib.net/\n\nThese libraries are open source and may be freely obtained, but they are not\nprovided as a part of this distribution.\n\nResources\n=========\n\nMore information about Thrift can be obtained on the Thrift webpage at:\n\n     http://developers.facebook.com/thrift\n\nAcknowledgments\n===============\n\nThrift was inspired by pillar, a lightweight RPC tool written by Adam D'Angelo.\n\nInstallation\n============\n\nIf you are building from the first time out of the source repository, you will\nneed to generate the configure scripts.  (This is not necessary if you\ndownloaded a tarball.)  From the top directory, do:\n\n    ./bootstrap.sh\n\nOnce the configure scripts are generated, thrift can be configured.\nFrom the top directory, do:\n\n    ./configure\n\nYou may need to specify the location of the boost files explicitly.\nIf you installed boost in /usr/local, you would run configure as follows:\n\n    ./configure --with-boost=/usr/local\n\nNote that by default the thrift C++ library is typically built with debugging\nsymbols included. If you want to customize these options you should use the\nCXXFLAGS option in configure, as such:\n\n        ./configure CXXFLAGS='-g -O2'\n        ./configure CFLAGS='-g -O2'\n        ./configure CPPFLAGS='-DDEBUG_MY_FEATURE'\n\nRun ./configure --help to see other configuration options\n\nPlease be aware that the Python library will ignore the --prefix option\nand just install wherever Python's distutils puts it (usually along\nthe lines of /usr/lib/pythonX.Y/site-packages/).  If you need to control\nwhere the Python modules are installed, set the PY_PREFIX variable.\n(DESTDIR is respected for Python and C++.)\n\nMake thrift:\n\n    make\n\nFrom the top directory, become superuser and do:\n\n    make install\n\nNote that some language packages must be installed manually using build tools\nbetter suited to those languages (at the time of this writing, this applies\nto Java, Ruby, PHP).\n\nLook for the README file in the lib/<language>/ folder for more details on the\ninstallation of each language library package.\n\n",

    "Readme": "== Welcome to Rails\n\nRails is a web-application and persistence framework that includes everything\nneeded to create database-backed web-applications according to the\nModel-View-Control pattern of separation. This pattern splits the view (also\ncalled the presentation) into \"dumb\" templates that are primarily responsible\nfor inserting pre-built data in between HTML tags. The model contains the\n\"smart\" domain objects (such as Account, Product, Person, Post) that holds all\nthe business logic and knows how to persist themselves to a database. The\ncontroller handles the incoming requests (such as Save New Account, Update\nProduct, Show Post) by manipulating the model and directing data to the view.\n\nIn Rails, the model is handled by what's called an object-relational mapping\nlayer entitled Active Record. This layer allows you to present the data from\ndatabase rows as objects and embellish these data objects with business logic\nmethods. You can read more about Active Record in\nlink:files/vendor/rails/activerecord/README.html.\n\nThe controller and view are handled by the Action Pack, which handles both\nlayers by its two parts: Action View and Action Controller. These two layers\nare bundled in a single package due to their heavy interdependence. This is\nunlike the relationship between the Active Record and Action Pack that is much\nmore separate. Each of these packages can be used independently outside of\nRails.  You can read more about Action Pack in\nlink:files/vendor/rails/actionpack/README.html.\n\n\n== Getting Started\n\n1. At the command prompt, start a new Rails application using the <tt>rails</tt> command\n   and your application name. Ex: rails myapp\n   (If you've downloaded Rails in a complete tgz or zip, this step is already done)\n2. Change directory into myapp and start the web server: <tt>script/server</tt> (run with --help for options)\n3. Go to http://localhost:3000/ and get \"Welcome aboard: You\u2019re riding the Rails!\"\n4. Follow the guidelines to start developing your application\n\n\n== Web Servers\n\nBy default, Rails will try to use Mongrel and lighttpd if they are installed, otherwise\nRails will use WEBrick, the webserver that ships with Ruby. When you run script/server,\nRails will check if Mongrel exists, then lighttpd and finally fall back to WEBrick. This ensures\nthat you can always get up and running quickly.\n\nMongrel is a Ruby-based webserver with a C component (which requires compilation) that is\nsuitable for development and deployment of Rails applications. If you have Ruby Gems installed,\ngetting up and running with mongrel is as easy as: <tt>gem install mongrel</tt>.\nMore info at: http://mongrel.rubyforge.org\n\nIf Mongrel is not installed, Rails will look for lighttpd. It's considerably faster than\nMongrel and WEBrick and also suited for production use, but requires additional\ninstallation and currently only works well on OS X/Unix (Windows users are encouraged\nto start with Mongrel). We recommend version 1.4.11 and higher. You can download it from\nhttp://www.lighttpd.net.\n\nAnd finally, if neither Mongrel or lighttpd are installed, Rails will use the built-in Ruby\nweb server, WEBrick. WEBrick is a small Ruby web server suitable for development, but not\nfor production.\n\nBut of course its also possible to run Rails on any platform that supports FCGI.\nApache, LiteSpeed, IIS are just a few. For more information on FCGI,\nplease visit: http://wiki.rubyonrails.com/rails/pages/FastCGI\n\n\n== Debugging Rails\n\nSometimes your application goes wrong.  Fortunately there are a lot of tools that\nwill help you debug it and get it back on the rails.\n\nFirst area to check is the application log files.  Have \"tail -f\" commands running\non the server.log and development.log. Rails will automatically display debugging\nand runtime information to these files. Debugging info will also be shown in the\nbrowser on requests from 127.0.0.1.\n\nYou can also log your own messages directly into the log file from your code using\nthe Ruby logger class from inside your controllers. Example:\n\n  class WeblogController < ActionController::Base\n    def destroy\n      @weblog = Weblog.find(params[:id])\n      @weblog.destroy\n      logger.info(\"#{Time.now} Destroyed Weblog ID ##{@weblog.id}!\")\n    end\n  end\n\nThe result will be a message in your log file along the lines of:\n\n  Mon Oct 08 14:22:29 +1000 2007 Destroyed Weblog ID #1\n\nMore information on how to use the logger is at http://www.ruby-doc.org/core/\n\nAlso, Ruby documentation can be found at http://www.ruby-lang.org/ including:\n\n* The Learning Ruby (Pickaxe) Book: http://www.ruby-doc.org/docs/ProgrammingRuby/\n* Learn to Program: http://pine.fm/LearnToProgram/  (a beginners guide)\n\nThese two online (and free) books will bring you up to speed on the Ruby language\nand also on programming in general.\n\n\n== Debugger\n\nDebugger support is available through the debugger command when you start your Mongrel or\nWebrick server with --debugger. This means that you can break out of execution at any point\nin the code, investigate and change the model, AND then resume execution! Example:\n\n  class WeblogController < ActionController::Base\n    def index\n      @posts = Post.find(:all)\n      debugger\n    end\n  end\n\nSo the controller will accept the action, run the first line, then present you\nwith a IRB prompt in the server window. Here you can do things like:\n\n  >> @posts.inspect\n  => \"[#<Post:0x14a6be8 @attributes={\\\"title\\\"=>nil, \\\"body\\\"=>nil, \\\"id\\\"=>\\\"1\\\"}>,\n       #<Post:0x14a6620 @attributes={\\\"title\\\"=>\\\"Rails you know!\\\", \\\"body\\\"=>\\\"Only ten..\\\", \\\"id\\\"=>\\\"2\\\"}>]\"\n  >> @posts.first.title = \"hello from a debugger\"\n  => \"hello from a debugger\"\n\n...and even better is that you can examine how your runtime objects actually work:\n\n  >> f = @posts.first\n  => #<Post:0x13630c4 @attributes={\"title\"=>nil, \"body\"=>nil, \"id\"=>\"1\"}>\n  >> f.\n  Display all 152 possibilities? (y or n)\n\nFinally, when you're ready to resume execution, you enter \"cont\"\n\n\n== Console\n\nYou can interact with the domain model by starting the console through <tt>script/console</tt>.\nHere you'll have all parts of the application configured, just like it is when the\napplication is running. You can inspect domain models, change values, and save to the\ndatabase. Starting the script without arguments will launch it in the development environment.\nPassing an argument will specify a different environment, like <tt>script/console production</tt>.\n\nTo reload your controllers and models after launching the console run <tt>reload!</tt>\n\n\n== Description of Contents\n\napp\n  Holds all the code that's specific to this particular application.\n\napp/controllers\n  Holds controllers that should be named like weblogs_controller.rb for\n  automated URL mapping. All controllers should descend from ApplicationController\n  which itself descends from ActionController::Base.\n\napp/models\n  Holds models that should be named like post.rb.\n  Most models will descend from ActiveRecord::Base.\n\napp/views\n  Holds the template files for the view that should be named like\n  weblogs/index.erb for the WeblogsController#index action. All views use eRuby\n  syntax.\n\napp/views/layouts\n  Holds the template files for layouts to be used with views. This models the common\n  header/footer method of wrapping views. In your views, define a layout using the\n  <tt>layout :default</tt> and create a file named default.erb. Inside default.erb,\n  call <% yield %> to render the view using this layout.\n\napp/helpers\n  Holds view helpers that should be named like weblogs_helper.rb. These are generated\n  for you automatically when using script/generate for controllers. Helpers can be used to\n  wrap functionality for your views into methods.\n\nconfig\n  Configuration files for the Rails environment, the routing map, the database, and other dependencies.\n\ndb\n  Contains the database schema in schema.rb.  db/migrate contains all\n  the sequence of Migrations for your schema.\n\ndoc\n  This directory is where your application documentation will be stored when generated\n  using <tt>rake doc:app</tt>\n\nlib\n  Application specific libraries.

    "Readme": "== Welcome to Payment\n\nPayment is used to process credit cards and electronic cash through merchant accounts.\n\nTo choose a gateway, require 'payment/gateway_name'. For example, if you want to use Authorize.net, do a require 'payment/authorize_net'. If you would like to use multiple gateways in the same code, simply do a require 'payment' and it will grab each gateway's code for you.\n\nPayment was inspired by and has borrowed much of its infrastructure from the Business::OnlinePayment Perl module (http://search.cpan.org/~jasonk/Business-OnlinePayment-2.01/OnlinePayment.pm).\n\nIf you would like to loosely check the validity of a credit card without using a merchant account, look at the CreditCard module (http://rubyforge.org/projects/creditcard/).\n\n== Example\n\n    require 'payment/authorize_net'\n\n    transaction = Payment::AuthorizeNet.new (\n                      :login       => 'username',\n                      :password    => 'password',\n                      :amount      => '49.95',\n                      :card_number => '4012888818888',\n                      :expiration  => '03/10',\n                      :first_name  => 'John',\n                      :last_name   => 'Doe'\n                     )\n    begin\n      transaction.submit\n      puts \"Card processed successfully: #{transaction.authorization}\"\n    rescue\n      puts \"Card was rejected: #{transaction.error_message}\"\n    end\n\nTo set default values, setup a file called .payment.yml in the home directory of the user who will be using this library.

To specify an alternative configuration file, add a :prefs => '/path/to/file.yml' to the initialization parameters.\n\n== Currently Supported Gateways\n\n* Authorize.Net (authorize_net) - http://www.authorize.net\n\n== Upcoming Gateways\n\n* Moneris - http://www.moneris.com\n* Skipjack - http://www.skipjack.com\n\n== Planned Support for the Following Gateways\n\n* Trust Commerce - http://www.trustcommerce.com\n* Verisign Payflow Pro - http://www.verisign.com\n* Cardstream - http://www.cardstream.com\n* Beanstream - http://www.beanstream.com\n* Vital - http://www.vitalps.com\n* Merchant Commerce - http://www.innuity.com\n* iAuthorizer - http://www.iauthorizer.com\n* Electronic Clearing House, Inc. - http://www.echo-inc.com\n* Bank of America eStores - http://www.bankofamerica.com\n* Network1Financial - http://www.eftsecure.com\n* eSec - http://www.esecpayments.com.au\n* Ingenico OCV - http://www.ingenico.com.au\n* St.George IPG - https://www.ipg.stgeorge.com.au\n* Jettis - http://www.jettis.com\n* PaymentsGateway.Net - http://www.paymentsgateway.net\n* PayConnect - http://www.paymentone.com\n* Secure Hosting UPG - http://www.securehosting.com\n\n== About\n\nAuthor::    Lucas Carlson  (mailto:lucas@rufy.com)\nCopyright:: Copyright (c) 2005 Lucas Carlson\nLicense::   Distributes under the same terms as Ruby\n\n",

    "Name": "starfish",
    "Readme": "== Welcome to Starfish\n\nStarfish is a utility to make distributed programming ridiculously easy.\n\n== Download\n\n* gem install starfish\n* http://rubyforge.org/projects/starfish\n* svn co svn://rubyforge.org//var/svn/starfish\n\n== Background\n\nStarfish was born by abstracting code from a highly popular website (http://mog.com). I had written distributed programming code for various tasks including database corruption cleanup as well as real-time indexing requirements and decided that nobody should have to write as much code as I did to do those tasks. The general idea of distributed programming is vastly underused by most programmers and Starfish hides everything you don't have to worry about.\n\n== Usage\n\nMake a file and define the server and client. What follows is a simple example:\n\n    # foo.rb\n    class Foo\n      attr_reader :i\n\n      def initialize\n        @i = 0\n      end\n\n      def inc\n        logger.info \"YAY it incremented by 1 up to #{@i}\"\n        @i += 1\n      end\n    end\n\n    server do |object|\n      object = Foo.new\n    end\n\n    client do |object|\n      object.inc\n    end\n\nNotice that you need not specify any network code, nor learn a foreign API like DRb or Rinda. You need not even define logger, starfish takes care of it for you at runtime. You just tell it how to serve an object and how to process the object. To run this code, simply run:\n\n    starfish foo.rb\n\nThis starts a server AND a client to start processing that object. The client runs in a continuous loop. If you call starfish foo.rb subsequent times from either the local machine or any machine on the local network, more clients will start processing the server concurrently.\n\nBy default, the server will start a log file at /tmp/foo.rb.log. You can override this behaviour.\n\n    server :log => \"/var/log/foo.log\" do |object|\n      object = Foo.new\n    end\n\nThe :log parameter is intelligent and can take various other formats including nil for no logging or instances of any kind of logger class you prefer to use.\n\n== MapReduce with ActiveRecord\n\nThe crown jewel of Starfish is actually a library built on Starfish called MapReduce. Inspired by Google's MapReduce (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MapReduce), it automates the process of divide and conquer for large data sets. Currently, Starfish's implementation only works with the ActiveRecord ORM from Ruby on Rails. The idea is that you have a very large data set that would be unmanageable to process otherwise. For example, let's say your database table has 30GB of information in it. It would be very difficult to keep 30GB of records in RAM at one time; even if you processed them serially, it would take a very long time. The idea is to have many clients grabbing chunks of the database at a time making much faster work, even on a single processor machine, than would otherwise be feasible.\n\nHere is the basic code that will get you up and running with MapReduce in Starfish.\n\n    # item.rb\n    ActiveRecord::Base.establish_connection(\n      :adapter  => \"mysql\",\n      :host     => \"localhost\",\n      :username => \"root\",\n      :password => \"\",\n      :database => \"some_database\"\n    )\n\n    class Item < ActiveRecord::Base; end\n\n    server do |map_reduce|\n      map_reduce.type = Item\n    end\n\n    client do |item|\n      logger.info item.id\n    end\n\nJust like the previous example, just run:\n\n    starfish item.rb\n\nStarfish takes care of the rest. The code above does the following:\n\n* The server grabs all the items via: Item.find(:all)\n* Each of the clients grab an item from the collection\n* When there are no more items to be grabbed, everything shuts down\n\nHowever there are cases when you might want some fancier behaviour.\n\n    server do |map_reduce|\n      map_reduce.type = Item\n      map_reduce.conditions = [\"some_important_flag = ?\", 1]\n      map_reduce.vigilant = true\n      map_reduce.queue_size = 1000\n    end\n\nHere are three new options: conditions, vigilant, and queue_size. Conditions simply limits what is grabbed via ActiveRecord. It is equivalent to saying: Item.find(:all, :conditions => [\"some_important_flag = ?\", 1]). Vigilant simply keeps the clients alive and when Item.find(:all) runs out of items, it will vigilantly poll for newly created items periodically. Queue size specifies the number of items buffered in the server queue. In the case of the 30GB database table, you do not want to grab all 30GB at once, instead you grab 1000 at a time as needed by your clients.\n\nAnother options you have when you use the vigilant option is map_reduce.empty_queue_wait which specifies how long to wait between polls for new information.\n\nThere is yet a third main run-mode for MapReduce under ActiveRecord.\n\n    server do |map_reduce|\n      map_reduce.type = Item\n      map_reduce.rescan_when_complete = true\n    end\n\nThe events follow like this when the rescan_when_complete option is enabled:\n\n* The server grabs all the items via: Item.find(:all)\n* Each of the clients grab an item from the collection\n* When there are no more items to be grabbed, the queue is re-filled via Item.find(:all) and the process starts again\n\nIf you need to continuously check over data for integrity, this option will meet your demands.\n\nAnother bonus you get while using MapReduce is automatic statistics. Simply call:\n\n    starfish item.rb stats\n\nAnd you will be returned a YAML hash of statistics.\n\n    --- \n    time_spent_grabbing_objects: 0.090328\n    time_spent_processing_objects: 0.023431\n    time_began: 2006-08-16 09:30:32.926399 -07:00\n    num_queues_grabbed: 5\n    time_spent_grabbing_queues: 0.090328\n    num_objects_grabbed: 10\n\n== MapReduce with Files\n\nYou can also divide and conquer with files. The idea is that you have a large file and want to process line-by-line as quickly as possible. It is simple to accomplish this with Starfish.\n\n    server do |map_reduce|\n      map_reduce.type = File\n      map_reduce.input = \"/tmp/big_log_file\"\n    end\n\n    client do |line|\n      if line =~ /some_regex/\n        logger.info(line)\n      end\n    end\n\nSimply replacing the type and input lets you process your file in a distributed way. Like when using ActiveRecord, you also have options:\n\n    server do |map_reduce|\n      map_reduce.type = File\n      map_reduce.input = \"/tmp/big_log_file\"\n      map_reduce.queue_size = 1000 # how many lines of the file to buffer at a time\n      map_reduce.lines_per_client = 100 # how many lines each client will process at a time\n      map_reduce.rescan_when_complete = true\n    end\n\nFor a file, rescan_when_complete goes back to the beginning of the file when you have finished processing it. You can also use the vigilant option to wait for new data to be added to the file.\n\n== Examples\n\nSee the examples/ directory.\n\n== Authors    \n* Lucas Carlson from MOG (mailto:lucas@rufy.com) - http://mog.com\n\nThis library is released under the terms of the BSD.\n\n\n",

YUI CSS grids.\n  - behavioral testing with rspec, including good example of mocking in controller specs.\n  - exception notification\n  - nested resources (user/assets)\n  - polymorphic asset model\n  - basic authorization\n  - around_filters\n\nPlease note, however, that much of the code is targeted at an intermediate/advanced level, so if you\ndon't understand the code, don't fret.\n\nINSTALL:\n\n  Quickstart: \n    Install Ruby, RubyGems, Rails with all its dependencies, a database package (MySQL, Postgresql, sqlite etc) and the appropriate bindings.\n      You will need the latest versions of all of these.  If you already have a working stack you might try\n        gem update --system\n        gem update rails\n\n    Install a few required gems: tzinfo, rspec\n    Create config/database.yml; if you don't know how to do this, then you probably won't learn anything from this app.\n    Import the database with rake db:migrate\n\n\n  It's strongly advised that you check out the stable version of any caboose sample app (it will have tags/v00x where x is a number).\n  You can do this with piston (jfgi) if you want to keep up to date.  Once a version is released, we aim to back-port bugfixes to\n  stable, but new features will go into the next version.\n\nTODO:\n\n  Sample controllers and models\n  More useful plugins\n  Good examples of ajax\n  Better list of requirements\n\nTODONE:\n\n  x Polymorphic Image model using attachment_fu\n\n\n",

    "Readme": "Hyperarchy\nHyperarchy is a collaborative decision-making tool based on ranked-pairs voting.\nThis version is a stripped-down prototype designed for internal use at GitHub.\nIt's licensed under the AGPL, and I will be developing it gradually based on our\nneeds and experience within GitHub over the coming months.\n\n\nHyperarchy is a Rails app and is designed for easy deployment to Heroku.\nWith exceptions noted below getting Hyperarchy running should be similar to any\nstandard Rails application that you'd put on Heroku. In addition to the typical\nPostgres database requirement, Hyperarchy also requires Redis and a real-time\nmessaging service called Pusher. Configuring the application\nwill require changes to environment variables in a .env file and entries in\ndatabase.yml.\nEnvironment Variables\nHyperarchy loads various environment variables from a .env file located in the\napplication's root in development. There's a .env.example file which lists various\nenvironment variables you'll need to run the application. Run cp .env.example .env\nand then edit the file to fill in relevant values for your variables.\n\nRAILS_SECRET_TOKEN: This is any random string, 128 characters long. Rails uses\nit as a unique identifier of your app for security purposes.\nPUSHER_URL: Hyperarchy uses a service called Pusher to\nsend real-time updates to clients. You'll need to setup an account with them,\nthen synthesize this URL based on the the API credentials. Don't follow the\ninstructions on their site, just find the page with a listing like the following\nand use these values to construct a URL based on the example:\nPusher.app_id = 'xxxx'\nPusher.key    = 'xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx'\nPusher.secret = 'xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx'\nPUSHER_CHANNEL: This can be any name. Different environments should have\ndifferent channel names, like \"hyperarchy_production\", \"hyperarchy_staging\",\nand \"hyperarchy_development\" so that messages stay separate.\nREDISTOGO_URL: Hyperarchy requires a Redis server for synchronization\npurposes. You can install redis with homebrew: brew install redis and follow\nthe instructions to start the server on your machine. Make sure the URL\nin the file matches your server's hostname and port.\n\nDatabase.yml\nLike most Rails apps, Hyperarchy depends on a relational database. Because it's\ndesigned for Heroku deployment, it uses PostgreSQL. If you're on a Mac, you can\ninstall Postgres with Homebrew:\nbrew install postgres\n\nThen follow the instructions (available via brew info postgres) to create the\ninitial database and start the server. You'll need to run cp\nconfig/database.yml.example config/database.yml and change the credentials for\nyour Postgres server. You can create a new Postgres user with the createuser\ncommand.\nInstalling Ruby and Gems\n\nInstall Ruby 1.9\nInstall Bundler: You may need to prefix this command with sudo depending on\nyour Ruby installation.\ngem install bundler\n\nInstall Hyperarchy's gems using Bundler:\nbundle install\n\n\nCreating and Migrating The Database\nMake sure your database server is started, then run rake db:create db:migrate\nto create and migrate the database. If you have problems here, it may be because\nyou didn't change database.yml to connect to your database.\nRunning\nFinally, should should be able to start the application:\nrails server\n\nRough edges around authentication\nThe basic authentication built into Hyperarchy is still pretty rough. We use\na GitHub-specific scheme at GitHub, but I wanted to add something in there to\nmake it easy to sign up and get started. Authentication is based on the\nomniauth-identity strategy, so\nreading its documentation may be a jumping off point for customizing the look of\nthe login screen.\nLogin errors don't display due to my custom ORM needing to implement ActiveModel.\nThis will be fixed in a future revision.\nDeployment\nThe application is designed to be deployed to Heroku. You'll need to enable the\nPusher and Redis To Go addons on your application in addition to the standard\nPostgres database. Also make sure you use heroku config:set to assign the\nRAILS_SECRET and the PUSHER_CHANNEL on your application. Then push and migrate\nthe databases. There's a deploy rake task to handle putting up a maintenance\npage when you need to push app changes that are bundled with migrations, but you'll\nneed to change the names of the heroku applications mentioned in the --app section.\n",

    "Name": "needy-controllers",
    "Readme": "NeedyControllers\n================\n\nNeedy Controllers is a way to DRY up commonly used tasks from both controllers and views \nto save time and effort. It consists of a single call with a number of options.\n\nDescription\n-----------\n\nWith needy controllers, you can include stylesheets, javascripts, and memoized record \nhelpers in your controllers and views with a much greater deal of specificity and \nautomation than hand-coding.\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\nscript/plugin install http://svn.intridea.com/svn/public/needy_controllers\n\nUsage\n=====\n\nStyles and Scripts\n------------------\n\nTo use Needy Controllers for styles and scripts, you simply call a \"needs\"  option\ninside your controller like so:\n\nclass MyController < ApplicationController\n  needs :styles => :standard\n  needs :styles => :show, :only => :show\n  needs :scripts => :behave, :except => :show\n\n  def index\n    # this action will have access to the 'standard.css' stylesheet\n  end\n\n  def show\n    # this action will have access to the 'show.css' stylesheet\n    # in addition to 'standard.css'\n    # but will not have access to 'behave.js'\n  end\nend\n\nNow that you have created your behavior and style chains, you need to include them \nin the view. Luckily, this is exceedingly easy! Just include :needs in your include \nand link tags like so:\n\n<%= stylesheet_link_tag 'something', :needs %>\n<%= javascript_include_tag 'prototype', :needs, 'effects' %>\n\nModel Fetching\n--------------\n\nTo use Needy Controllers for fetching records, you use it similarly, and it sets \nthe instance variable:\n\nclass MyController < ApplicationController\n  # here's a standard problem\n  needs :record => :user, :from => :id, :as => :user\nend\n\nThe :from and :as options in this example are the defaults (:id for :from and :as \ndefaults to the name of the record). This will create a method (\"user\" in the example)\nthat will be accessible both from the controller and from the view as a helper. It\nwill find the record with a matching ID to the URL parameter associated with the\n:from option. Therefore if you had nested resources you could call it as such:\n\nneeds :record => :user, :from => :user_id\n\nFlushing and Removal of Needs\n-----------------------------\n\nIf for some reason you want a controller not to inherit existing needs or you for some \nreason want to remove needs, there's a simple way to remove them:\n\nclass MyController < ApplicationController\n  does_not_need :anything       # removes all styles and behaviors from the need chain\n  does_not_need :any_styles\n  does_not_need :any_scripts\n  does_not_need :styles => \"some_style\"\n  does_not_need :styles => [\"some_style\", \"another_one\"]  \n  does_not_need :scripts => \"some_script\"\nend\n\nResources\n=========\n\nCreated by Michael Bleigh (michael@intridea.com) \n        of Intridea (http://www.intridea.com)\n\nComments, bugs, and patches go to http://trac.intridea.com/trac/public\n\n",

Let's also say that i've put it into a stylesheet in stylesheets/complex.css.\n\nMy stylesheet link tag looks something like this:\n\n<%= stylesheet_link_tag 'complex' %>\n\nNow all I have to do to target a browser is create a new CSS file with the browser's\nidentifier appended to it with an underscore (e.g. \"complex_ie6.css\"). That's it!\nThe same exact stylesheet link tag will automatically check the current user\nagent and load a browser-specific CSS file if it exists. Ta-da! One-step browser\nstyles!\n\n=== Identifiers ===\n\nBrowsers and OS's are identified as following. You would create the CSS file as \n\"yourcssfile_browsername.css\" or \"yourcssfile_osname\" or \"yourcssfile_browsername_osname\"\n\n==== Browsers ====\n\nIE6:       ie6\nIE7:       ie7\nOpera:     opera\nFirefox:   gecko\nSafari:    safari\nKonqueror: konqueror\n\n==== Operating Systems ====\n\nMac OS (X or prior): mac\nWindows (any): win\nLinux: linux\n\n=== Limitations and Caveats ===\n\nAt this time the plugin is only designed to work with .css files in your stylesheets \ndirectory. It will not work at present with URL-based stylesheets or stylesheets not\nfound in your stylesheets directory (or some subdirectory thereof).\n\nAt the moment, stylesheets are included in this order: original, browser-specific, \nos-specific, browser-and-os-specific. This is logically from least to most specific,\nbut if you need a different order you will have to hack it manually.\n\n=== Resources ===\n\nBlog Article: http://www.intridea.com/2007/12/9/announcing-browserized-styles\nTrac: http://trac.intridea.com/trac/public/\nSVN: script/plugin install http://svn.intridea.com/svn/public/browserized_styles\n\nCopyright (c) 2007 Michael Bleigh and Intridea, Inc., released under the MIT license\n\n",
