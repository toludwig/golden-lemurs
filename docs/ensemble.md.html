<h1 id="the-ensemble-network">The Ensemble Network</h1>
<p>After training of all the networks we needed to make a decision: Which networks are worthy to be integrated in the final classificator regarding accuracy but also regarding the amount of computation time.</p>
<p>We choosed only the following two networks:</p>
<ul>
<li>the CNN for README</li>
<li>and the CNN for the Commit times.</li>
</ul>
<p>These give us their predictions and we feed them into our master net, the Ensemble Network.</p>
<p>This is an easy two-layer <em>feed forward</em> topology for learning non-linear weightings of the CNN predictions. For example it should learn to rely only on the Commits if the README is empty.</p>
