This directory contains the various training scripts for the neural networks.


The scripts themselves mostly just call the constructor of the respective network and train/validate
from classification.Training. Refer to those files for more exhaustive documentation. The architectures and the parameters are also described in our documentation.


Feel free to experiment with the parameters.
