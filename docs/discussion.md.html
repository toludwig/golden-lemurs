<h2 id="résumé-of-our-3-approaches">Résumé of our 3 approaches</h2>
<p>The word2vec approach we applied to the Commits and the Readme proved to be highly satisfactory. This is what we expected because the texts carry really a lot of information.</p>
<p>We are not supprised by the bad performance of the FFN as we did no data preprocessing and it is in general difficult to learn on such variable numeric values.</p>
<p>On the other hand we realize that we expected too much from the commit time data. Therefore it is no wonder that the LSTM performs badly.</p>
<h2 id="choice-of-the-data">Choice of the Data</h2>
<p>The approach of picking Github repos by searching for keywords only yields really clear categorizable data. We have caught few false positives with that. On the other hand we do not cover cases at the border between two classes that well.</p>
<p>And of course, with more data the classification would improve. For example repos of category DOCS were underrepresented in our training set. Also it would be a good idea to consider issues with our textual approach. However, we experienced shortcomings in the data retrieval with the Github API. Using a multi-threaded approach running on multiple computers took us (including debugging of our crawling algorithm) almost a week.</p>
<h2 id="the-boon-and-bane-of-semantic-analysis">The boon and bane of semantic analysis</h2>
<p>We clearly focus on the textual parts of the repo.</p>
<p>A problem of this is that by only considering semantic information we fail to see for data formats sometimes, for example we struggle to classify the websites that are <em>about</em> EDU-, HW- or other content.</p>
<p>While this can be a pitfall, in general the strength of our classificator is its focus on the semantics of the texts. For example repos that look like WEB but are actually hidden APIs are more likely to be rightly classified as DOCS by our classificator.</p>

<p>Here are three URLs on which our approach semantic approach should also perform well.</p>

<p>The 1. is a DEV but contains many references to courses. Anyway the net is very sure that this it is DEV. No. 2 is correctly classified as a HW repo although there is no README. The last repo is a special HW, because it is very often forked and starred.</p>
